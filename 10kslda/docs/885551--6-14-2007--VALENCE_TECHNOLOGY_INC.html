                    WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS IN OUR PRODUCTION PROCESSES THAT HAVE LIMITED OUR ABILITY AT TIMES TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT BATTERIES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OUR CUSTOMERS. IF THESE ISSUES RECUR AND WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY RESOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, OUR INABILITY TO PRODUCE BATTERIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO GROW REVENUES AND MAINTAIN OUR CUSTOMER BASE.
OUR LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALLY EXPLOIT OUR TECHNOLOGY AND OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO UNANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENT, AND COULD PLACE US AT A DISADVANTAGE TO OUR COMPETITORS.
WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT AND MAY NEVER ACHIEVE OR SUSTAIN SIGNIFICANT REVENUES OR PROFITABILITY.
IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO PROVIDE FOR OUR OPERATING NEEDS.
OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY INCREASE BEYOND THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED.
OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT TO FUND FUTURE NEEDS.
ALL OF OUR ASSETS ARE PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL UNDER OUR LOAN AGREEMENTS. OUR FAILURE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR LOAN AGREEMENTS COULD RESULT IN FORECLOSURE OF OUR ASSETS.
WE DEPEND ON A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FOR OUR REVENUES, AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE HARMED IF WE WERE TO LOSE THE BUSINESS OF ANY ONE OF THEM.
OUR BUSINESS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR SAPHION(R) TECHNOLOGY BATTERIES ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTED.
IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT GAIN WIDE CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.
IF OUR PRODUCTS FAIL TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED, WE COULD LOSE EXISTING AND FUTURE BUSINESS, AND OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, MARKET AND SELL OUR BATTERIES COULD BE HARMED.
OUR FAILURE TO COST-EFFECTIVELY MANUFACTURE OUR TECHNOLOGICALLY COMPLEX BATTERIES IN COMMERCIAL QUANTITIES WHICH SATISFY OUR CUSTOMERS' PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS AND THEIR EXPECTATIONS FOR PRODUCT QUALITY AND DELIVERY COULD DAMAGE OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR US.
IN ADDITION TO BEING USED IN OUR OWN PRODUCT LINES, OUR BATTERY CELLS ARE INTENDED TO BE INCORPORATED INTO OTHER PRODUCTS. IF WE DO NOT FORM EFFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH OEMS TO COMMERCIALIZE THESE PRODUCTS, OUR PROFITABILITY COULD BE IMPAIRED.
FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT AN EFFECTIVE LICENSING BUSINESS STRATEGY WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE, CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY.
THE FACT THAT WE DEPEND ON A SOLE SOURCE SUPPLIER OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS FOR KEY RAW MATERIALS MAY DELAY OUR PRODUCTION OF BATTERIES.
WE HAVE FOUR KEY EXECUTIVES, THE LOSS OF ANY OF WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.
OUR ONGOING MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IN CHINA ARE COMPLEX AND HAVING THESE REMOTE OPERATIONS MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION, LEAD TO DISRUPTIONS IN OPERATIONS AND DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.
WE EXPECT TO SELL AN INCREASING PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS TO AND DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR LICENSING REVENUES FROM CUSTOMERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. FOREIGN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL SALES COULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS AND LICENSES UNAFFORDABLE IN FOREIGN MARKETS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.
WE MAY NEED TO EXPAND OUR EMPLOYEE BASE AND OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS COMMERCIALLY, WHICH MAY STRAIN OUR MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCES AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.
COMPETITION FOR PERSONNEL, IN PARTICULAR FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION PERSONNEL, IS INTENSE, AND WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING THE PERSONNEL NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.
INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL EVENTS AND THE THREAT OF ONGOING TERRORIST ACTIVITIES COULD INTERRUPT MANUFACTURING OF OUR BATTERIES AND OUR PRODUCTS AT OUR OEM FACILITIES OR OUR OWN FACILITIES AND CAUSE US TO LOSE SALES AND MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES.
IF WE ARE SUED ON A PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM, OUR INSURANCE POLICIES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.
OUR PATENT APPLICATIONS MAY NOT RESULT IN ISSUED PATENTS, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALLY EXPLOIT OUR PRODUCTS.
IF WE CANNOT PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR EXISTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR IF OUR PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS DO NOT RESULT IN ISSUED PATENTS, WE MAY LOSE THE ADVANTAGES OF OUR RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE TO DEFEND, AND IF ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES IS FOUND TO BE INFRINGING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROCURE LICENSES TO USE PATENTS NECESSARY TO OUR BUSINESS AT REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.
SINCE OUR PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN CHINA AND WE HAVE TRANSFERRED ADDITIONAL OPERATIONS TO CHINA, WE FACE RISKS IF CHINA LOSES NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS STATUS WITH THE UNITED STATES.
BECAUSE THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM IN GENERAL, AND THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REGIME IN PARTICULAR, ARE RELATIVELY WEAK, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE.
ENFORCING AGREEMENTS AND LAWS IN CHINA IS DIFFICULT OR MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE AS CHINA DOES NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF LAWS.
THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA MAY CHANGE OR EVEN REVERSE ITS POLICIES OF PROMOTING PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT, IN WHICH CASE OUR ASSETS AND OPERATIONS MAY BE AT RISK.
THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA CONTINUES TO EXERCISE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OVER THE CHINESE ECONOMY WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.
CHANGES IN CHINA'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POLICIES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.
BUSINESS PRACTICES IN CHINA MAY ENTAIL GREATER RISK AND DEPENDENCE UPON THE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT THAN IS COMMON IN NORTH AMERICA AND THEREFORE SOME OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER PARTIES IN CHINA COULD BE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO ENFORCE.
OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY INTERRUPTED, AND WE MAY SUFFER A LARGE AMOUNT OF LOSS, IN THE CASE OF FIRE, CASUALTY OR THEFT AT ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING OR OTHER FACILITIES.
THE SYSTEM OF TAXATION IN CHINA IS UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE CHANGE THAT COULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.
IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER VALUE-ADDED TAXES IMPOSED BY THE CHINESE TAXING AUTHORITY.
ANY RECURRENCE OF SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME ("SARS"), AVIAN FLU, OR ANOTHER WIDESPREAD PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
IF COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES THAT OUTPERFORM OUR BATTERIES WERE DEVELOPED AND SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCED, THEN OUR PRODUCTS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR TARGETED MARKET SEGMENTS.
OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES THAN WE DO AND THEY MAY THEREFORE DEVELOP BATTERIES SIMILAR OR SUPERIOR TO OURS OR OTHERWISE COMPETE MORE SUCCESSFULLY THAN WE DO.
LAWS REGULATING THE MANUFACTURE OR TRANSPORTATION OF BATTERIES MAY BE ENACTED WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DELAY IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR BATTERIES OR THE IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO BE PROFITABLE.
CORPORATE INSIDERS OR THEIR AFFILIATES WILL BE ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OVER MATTERS REQUIRING STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL THAT MIGHT NOT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS AS A WHOLE.
WHICH COULD DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK AND LIMIT THE PRICE THAT POTENTIAL ACQUIRERS MAY BE WILLING TO PAY FOR OUR COMMON STOCK.
AT ANY GIVEN TIME WE MIGHT NOT MEET THE CONTINUED LISTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE NASDAQ SMALLCAP MARKET.
OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT.
FUTURE SALES OF CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING SHARES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE.
WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, AND THEREFORE STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER THEIR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK, IF AT ALL, ONLY BY SELLING THE SHARES OF OUR STOCK THAT THEY HOLD.
OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE THAT HAS INCREASED BOTH OUR COSTS AND THE RISK OF NONCOMPLIANCE.
