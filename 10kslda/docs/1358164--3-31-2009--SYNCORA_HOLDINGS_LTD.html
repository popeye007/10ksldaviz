                    Risks Related to Our Company
We may be unable to enter into or close the 2009 MTA or close the tender offer on the terms contemplated, on different terms or at all, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Syncora Guarantee s Board of Directors, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, may determine that it is necessary to suspend claim payments to preserve assets for the benefit of all policyholders.
Even if we consummate the transactions contemplated by the 2009 MTA and the tender offer, we may continue to report policyholders deficit or become insolvent in the future.
We are operating in an adverse business environment and have experienced higher than expected losses resulting from our exposure to the RMBS market and anticipated claims on CDOs, including
ABS CDOs, that have had, and may continue to have, material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We have suspended writing substantially all new business as of January 2008 and we do not expect to recommence writing new business.
Adverse developments in the credit and mortgage markets and the negative impact those adverse developments have had, and may continue to have, on our in-force business has resulted in material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Loss reserve estimates are subject to uncertainties and our loss reserves for certain periods may not be adequate to cover the ultimate amount of losses. If we establish additional loss reserves, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The fair value of liabilities respecting our CDS contract guarantees may increase reflecting the market perception of losses on such securities. The fair value of our CDS contracts may also be adversely affected by any improvement in our Non-Performance Risk which is reflected in the fair value of our CDS contracts. Also, anticipated claims on our CDS contracts may continue to develop adversely. Each of the aforementioned factors may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
We are highly regulated and a regulator could rehabilitate or liquidate us or take certain other actions.
If Syncora Guarantee should become subject to a regulatory proceeding or becomes insolvent, the holders of certain of the CDS contracts Syncora Guarantee has insured may assert the right to terminate the contracts and require Syncora Guarantee to pay them the termination values, which under current market conditions would be in excess of Syncora Guarantee s resources.
There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The poor performance of the debt and equity securities that we hold as investments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
Payment of claims on our guaranteed obligations, including Jefferson County, Alabama and RMBS transactions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.
If counterparties to certain of the CDS contracts Syncora Guarantee has insured should become subject to a bankruptcy, insolvency or analogous regulatory proceeding, they may have the right to terminate the contracts and require Syncora Guarantee to make termination payments as a consequence of such termination, which under current market conditions would be in excess of Syncora Guarantee s resources.
Syncora Guarantee or Syncora Guarantee-UK may lose certain control rights under certain financial guarantee insurance policies if they fail to make a payment, or if either is insolvent or placed into receivership or liquidation.
Certain of our policyholders and counterparties may not pay premiums and makewholes owed to us or may seek to cancel their policies due to bankruptcy or other reasons.
We have agreed not to make any dividends or distributions to our shareholders for a period of time and failure by us to pay dividends on the Syncora Holdings Series A Preference Shares could have a material adverse effect on the common shareholders board representation.
Portfolio modeling contains uncertainty over ultimate outcomes which makes it difficult to estimate our potential paid claims and loss reserves.
Under the 2009 MTA contemplated by the Letter of Intent, Syncora Guarantee will contribute significant funds to capitalize Drop-Down Company and such funds may not be available to Syncora Guarantee.
Under the 2009 MTA contemplated by the Letter of Intent, Syncora Guarantee will pay cash consideration and issue certain surplus notes to the Counterparties as part of the consideration for their agreement to commute their policies and such cash consideration and any payments made on such surplus notes will reduce the funds available to Syncora Guarantee.
If either Syncora Guarantee or Syncora Guarantee-UK should become insolvent or has a receiver appointed, Syncora Guarantee may have to forego the right to receive any future premiums from Syncora Guarantee-UK, Syncora Guarantee-UK may have a right to claim back all or a proportion
of any premiums already paid to Syncora Guarantee and the FSA UK may intervene in Syncora Guarantee-UK s operations.
Syncora Guarantee is required to provide Syncora Guarantee-UK with funds to maintain its compliance with its minimum solvency margin and these amounts could be material.
There is a possibility that the 2008 MTA, or the 2009 MTA if entered into and consummated, the related commutations and releases could be challenged, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
Ratings downgrades have triggered and withdrawal of ratings may trigger additional provisions in our business arrangements and agreements to which we are party or subject in a manner adverse to our business.
If the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements default on their obligations to us, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our insurance and reinsurance portfolio and financial guarantee products expose us to concentrations of risks, and a material adverse event or series of events with respect to one or more of these risks could result in significant losses to our business.
Some of our direct financial guarantee products differ from traditional financial guarantee insurance, principally because these less traditional products, including CDS contracts, may require us to make payments of the full guaranteed amount earlier than, or upon the occurrence of events not covered by, traditional products. In certain of these events, we may be required to pay amounts in excess of our current resources.
Rules relating to certain accounting practices in the financial guarantee insurance industry have been changed and will cause us to de-recognize our reserves for unallocated losses and loss adjustment expenses, which has had a material adverse effect on our reported operating results and financial condition.
Our valuation of our CDS contracts may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
If we are not able to retain key employees, we may be unable to successfully implement our strategic plan or operate our business.
Our shares have been de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.
General economic factors, including those as a result of the current financial crisis, may adversely affect our loss experience and our investment portfolio.
We face significant litigation risks.
Legislative and regulatory changes and interpretations could materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict.
Because our financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance policies are unconditional and irrevocable, we may incur losses from fraudulent conduct relating to the securities that we insure or reinsure.
Servicer risk could adversely impact performance of our structured finance transactions.
We are currently limited in our ability to utilize our tax losses to obtain tax benefits, including a limitation on our ability to fully utilize net operating loss carryforwards recognized as of August 5, 2008.
Our NOLs could be substantially further limited if we experience another ownership change.
The limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs recognized prior to the August 5, 2008 ownership change or a subsequent ownership change will be more substantial, and will have an additional material negative impact on the Company, if the Internal Revenue Service does not grant our request to change our method of accounting for unpaid loss reserves.
The appropriate federal income tax treatment of guaranteed CDS contracts we have issued is currently unclear, which could negatively impact the character and timing of income, gain or loss recognized by us in connection with these contracts.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Shares
Because we are a holding company and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries, our ability to meet any ongoing cash requirements, including any debt service payments or other expenses, and to pay dividends on our preferred or common shares in the future will depend on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other cash payments or obtain loans from our subsidiaries, which are regulated insurance companies and whose ability to pay dividends or make loans to us is limited by regulatory constraints.
The SCA Shareholder Entity owns approximately 46% of our outstanding common shares and has the ability to exert significant influence over us. In addition, conflicts may arise between us and the SCA Shareholder Entity that could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us or investors in our securities.
Under the 2009 MTA as contemplated by the Letter of Intent, the Counterparties will own approximately 40% of our outstanding common shares upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated thereby and may exercise some level of control over our Board of Directors and they may have conflicts of interest with us.
Our subsidiaries ratings are not evaluations directed to the protection of investors in our common or preferred shares.
There are provisions in our bye-laws that, subject to certain exceptions, reduce the voting rights of common shares that are held by a person or group to the extent that such person or group holds more than 9.5% of the aggregate voting power of all common shares entitled to vote on a matter.
There are provisions in our bye-laws which may limit a shareholder s voting rights if our Board of Directors determines to do so to avoid certain material adverse legal, tax or regulatory consequences.
There are provisions in our bye-laws that may restrict shareholders ability to transfer common shares and, therefore, may affect the liquidity of common shares.
Bermuda Law and our bye-laws provide broad indemnity and exculpation protections for the benefit of our officers, directors and employees.
Provisions in our bye-laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors or change our direction or policies, which could diminish the value of our common shares.
There are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our common shares.
Our Shareholders may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation.
We are a Bermuda company and it may be difficult for our shareholders to enforce judgments against us or against our directors and executive officers.
