Markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of high volatility accompanied by reduced liquidity.

If the Company s investment in the common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago is other than temporarily impaired, its financial condition and results of operations could be materially impaired.
As a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of the Company s operations through its subsidiaries, its ability to pay dividends, repurchase its shares, or to repay its indebtedness depends upon liquid assets held by the bank holding company, as well as the results of operations of the Company s subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to other restrictions.
The Company must seek additional capital in the future, but capital may not be available when it is needed.
The Company s effective tax rates may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state tax laws.
An interruption in or breach in security of the Company s information systems may result in a loss of customer business.

The outstanding shares of the Company s Series G preferred stock may be converted by the U.S. Treasury at any time or will be converted if certain conditions are met, which will dilute the Company s existing stockholders in the case of conversion. In addition, the Company s ability to pay dividends on those shares is restricted.
