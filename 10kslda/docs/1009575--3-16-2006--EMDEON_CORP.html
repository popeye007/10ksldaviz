                    Emdeon Business Services transaction volume and financial results could be adversely affected if we do not maintain relationships with practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare EDI transactions
Contractual relationships with governmental customers may impose special burdens on us and provide special benefits to those customers, including the right to change or terminate the contract in response to budgetary constraints or policy changes
Lengthy sales, installation and implementation cycles for some Emdeon Business Services applications and some Emdeon Practice Services applications may result in unanticipated fluctuations in their revenues
Emdeon Practice Services faces competition in providing support services to owners of The Medical Manager and other systems
Risks Related to the Businesses of WebMD
WebMD has incurred and may continue to incur losses
The timing of WebMD s advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter
Lengthy sales and implementation cycles for WebMD s private online portals make it difficult to forecast revenues from these applications
If WebMD is unable to provide content that attracts and retains users to The WebMD Health Network at a level that is attractive to advertisers and sponsors, WebMD s revenue will be reduced
If WebMD is unable to provide healthcare content for its offline publications that attracts and retains users, its revenue will be reduced
A decline in user traffic levels for The WebMD Health Network could have a material adverse effect on its advertising and sponsorship revenue
WebMD may be unsuccessful in its efforts to increase advertising and sponsorship revenue from consumer products companies
WebMD may be subject to claims brought against it as a result of content it provides
WebMD faces potential liability related to the privacy and security of personal information it collects from consumer and healthcare professionals through its Web sites
Changes in industry guidelines or government regulation could adversely affect WebMD s online Medscape CME offerings
Risks Related to the Development and Performance of the Products and Services of Emdeon Business Services, Emdeon Practice Services and WebMD
Our ability to generate revenue could suffer if we do not continue to update and improve our existing products and services and develop new ones
Developing and implementing new or updated products and services may take longer and cost more than expected
New or updated products and services will not become profitable unless they achieve sufficient levels of market acceptance
Achieving market acceptance of new or updated products and services is likely to require significant efforts and expenditures
We could be subject to breach of warranty, product liability or other claims if our software products, information technology systems or transmission systems contain errors or experience failures
Performance problems with our systems or system failures, whether caused by hardware, software or other problems, could cause us to lose business or incur liabilities
During times when we are making significant changes to our products and services or to systems we use to provide services, there are increased risks of performance problems
If our systems or the Internet experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure, our business could suffer
Performance problems with Emdeon Business Services systems could affect our relationships with customers of Emdeon Practice Services
Emdeon Business Services ability to provide transaction services depends on services provided by telecommunications companies
Risks Applicable to Our Use of the Internet
Our Internet-based services are dependent on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure
Delivery of Web-based services requires uninterrupted communications and computer service from third-party service providers and our own systems
Third parties may challenge the enforceability of our online agreements
Government regulation of the Internet could adversely affect our business
Risks Related to Providing Products and Services to the Healthcare Industry
Developments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business
Governmental and private initiatives to support adoption of healthcare information technology may encourage additional companies to enter our markets, may provide advantages to our competitors and may result in the development of technology solutions that compete with ours
Government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies
Risks Related to Porex s Business and Industry
Porex s success depends upon demand for its products, which in some cases ultimately depends upon end-user demand for the products of its customers
Porex s product offerings must meet changing customer requirements
Potential new or enhanced Porex products may not achieve sufficient sales to be profitable or justify the cost of their development
Porex may not be able to source the raw materials it needs or may have to pay more for those raw materials
Disruptions in Porex s manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results
Porex may not be able to keep third parties from using technology it has developed
The nature of Porex s products exposes it to product liability claims that may not be adequately covered by indemnity agreements or insurance
Economic, political and other risks associated with Porex s international sales and geographically diverse operations could adversely affect Porex s operations and financial results
Environmental regulation could adversely affect Porex s business
Risks Applicable to Our Entire Company and to Ownership of Our Securities
The ongoing investigations by the United States Attorney for the District of South Carolina and the SEC could negatively impact our company and divert management attention from our business operations
Recent and pending management changes may disrupt our operations and our ability to recruit and retain other personnel
We cannot assure you that the decision to evaluate strategic alternatives with respect to our Emdeon Business Services and Emdeon Practice Services segments will result in us pursuing a transaction or that any such transaction would be successfully completed
Whether or not we pursue a transaction involving Emdeon Business Services and Emdeon Practice Services, there may be negative impacts on the businesses in those segments as a result of the evaluation of strategic alternatives
Our success depends, in part, on our attracting and retaining qualified executives and employees
We face significant competition for our products and services
Third parties may bring claims as a result of the activities of our strategic partners or resellers of our products and services
We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights
Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services
We have incurred and may continue to incur losses
Acquisitions, business combinations and other transactions may be difficult to complete and, if completed, may have negative consequences for our business and our securityholders
Our business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or to assess the risks in particular transactions
