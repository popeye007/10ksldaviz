Losses due to defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities (which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage-backed securities or other high yielding bonds), reinsurance counterparties or third party investment managers could adversely affect the value of our investments, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
