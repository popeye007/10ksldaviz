                    The ongoing downturn in the general economy and the real estate market has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the Company s business and financial results.
The ongoing adverse developments in the credit markets and the risk of continued market deterioration have adversely affected the Company s revenues, expenses and operating results and may continue to do so.
If the Company fails to meet its payment or other obligations under its senior secured credit facility, then the lenders under such credit facility could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of its assets.
We experienced additional, unanticipated costs and may have additional risk and further costs as a result of the restatement of our financial statements.
The Company may not be able to obtain additional financing when the Company needs it or on acceptable terms, and any such financing, or the failure to obtain financing, may adversely affect the market price of the Company s common stock.
We have received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) that we did not meet its continued listing requirements. If we are unable to rectify this non-compliance in accordance with NYSE rules, our common stock will be delisted from trading on the NYSE, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of our common stock.
The Company is in a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than it does.
The TIC business in general, from which the Company has historically generated significant revenues, materially contracted in 2008.
As a service-oriented company, the Company depends on key personnel, and the loss of its current personnel or its failure to hire and retain additional personnel could harm its business.
The Company plans to expand its business to include international operations that could subject it to social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries.
Failure to manage any future growth effectively may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to the Company s Transaction Services and Management Services Business
The Company s quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate due to the seasonal nature of its business and may fail to meet expectations, which may cause the price of its securities to decline.
If the properties that the Company manages fail to perform, then its business and results of operations could be harmed.
If the Company fails to comply with laws and regulations applicable to real estate brokerage and mortgage transactions and other business lines, then it may incur significant financial penalties.
The Company may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property and facilities management activities.
Environmental regulations may adversely impact the Company s business and/or cause the Company to incur costs for cleanup of hazardous substances or wastes or other environmental liabilities.
Risks Related to the Company s Investment Management and Broker-Dealer Business
Declines in asset value and reductions in distributions in investment programs could adversely affect the Company business, as it could cause harm to the Company s reputation, cause the loss of management contracts and third-party broker-dealer selling agreements, limit the Company s ability to sign future third-party broker-dealer selling agreements and potentially expose the Company to legal liability.
The Company currently provides its Investment Management services primarily to its programs. Its revenue depends on the number of its programs, on the price of the properties acquired or disposed of by these programs, and on the revenue generated by the properties under its management.
The Company may be unable to grow its programs, which would cause it to fail to satisfy its business strategy.
The inability to access investors for the Company s programs through broker-dealers or other intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on its business.
The termination of any of the Company s broker-dealer relationships, especially given the limited number of key broker-dealers, could have a material adverse effect on its business.
Misconduct by third-party selling broker-dealers or the Company s sales force, could have a material adverse effect on its business.
A significant amount of the Company s revenue has historically been derived from fees earned through the transaction structuring and property management of its TIC Programs, which programs rely primarily on Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code to provide for deferral of capital gains taxes to make these programs attractive. A change in this tax code section or a complete revocation of this section as it relates specifically to TICs could materially impact these programs.
A significant amount of the Company s programs are structured to provide favorable tax treatment to investors or REITs. If a program fails to satisfy the requirements necessary to permit this favorable tax treatment, the Company could be subject to claims by investors and its reputation for structuring these transactions would be negatively affected, which would have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.
Any future co-investment activities the Company undertakes could subject it to real estate investment risks which could lead to the need for substantial capital contributions, which may impact its cash flows and financial condition and, if it is unable to make them, could damage its reputation and result in adverse consequences to its holdings.
Geographic concentration of program properties may expose the Company s programs to regional economic downturns that could adversely impact their operations and, as a result, the fees the Company is able to generate from them, including fees on disposition of the properties as the Company may be limited in its ability to dispose of properties in a challenging real estate market.
The failure of Triple Net Properties, LLC, recently renamed Grubb Ellis Realty Investors, LLC ( GERI ) and Triple Net Properties Realty, Inc. ( Realty ), subsidiaries of the Company acquired in the Merger, to hold certain required real estate licenses may subject Realty and the Company to penalties, such as fines, restitution payments and termination of management agreements, and to the suspension or revocation of certain broker licenses.
If third-party managers providing property management services for the Company s programs office, medical office and healthcare related facilities, retail and multi-family properties are negligent in their performance of, or default on, their management obligations, the tenants may not renew their leases or the Company may become subject to unforeseen liabilities. If this occurs, it could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and operating results.
The Company or its new programs may be required to incur future indebtedness to raise sufficient funds to purchase properties.
The Company may be required to repay loans the Company guaranteed that were used to finance properties acquired by the Company s programs.
The revenue streams from the Company s management services may be subject to limitation or cancellation.
Future pressures to lower, waive or credit back the Company s fees could reduce the Company s revenue and profitability.
Regulatory uncertainties related to the Company s broker-dealer services could harm the Company s business.
The Company depends upon its programs tenants to pay rent, and their inability to pay rent may substantially reduce certain fees the Company receives which are based on gross rental amounts.
Conflicts of interest inherent in transactions between the Company s programs and the Company, and among its programs, could create liability for the Company that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.
The offerings conducted to raise capital for the Company s TIC Programs are done in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. A failure to satisfy the requirements for the appropriate exemption could void the offering or, if it is already completed, provide the investors with rescission rights, either of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company s reputation and as a result its business and results of operations.
The inability to identify suitable refinance options may negatively impact investment program performance and cause harm to the Company s reputation, cause the loss of management contracts and third-party broker-dealer selling agreements, limit the Company s ability to sign future third-party broker-dealer selling agreements and potentially expose the Company to legal liability.
An increase in interest rates may negatively affect the equity value of the Company s programs or cause the Company to lose potential investors to alternative investments, causing the fees the Company receives for transaction and management services to be reduced.
Increasing competition for the acquisition of real estate may impede the Company s ability to make future acquisitions which would reduce the fees the Company generates from these programs and could adversely affect the Company s operating results and financial condition.
Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede the Company s ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of the Company s programs properties and harm the Company s financial condition.
Uninsured and underinsured losses may adversely affect operations.
Risks Related to the Company in General
Delaware law and provisions of the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay, deter or prevent a change of control.
As a consequence the amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation adopted in connection with the Merger, the Company has a staggered board, which may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be deemed to be in the best interests of stockholders.
The Company has the ability to issue blank check preferred stock, which could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.
The Company has registration rights outstanding, which could have a negative impact on its share price if exercised.
Future sales of the Company s common stock could adversely affect its stock price
