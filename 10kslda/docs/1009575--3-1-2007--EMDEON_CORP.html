                    WebMD faces significant competition for its products and services
Failure to maintain and enhance the WebMD brand could have a material adverse effect on WebMD s business
WebMD s online businesses have a limited operating history
If WebMD is unable to provide healthcare content for its offline publications that attracts and retains users, its revenue will be reduced
The timing of WebMD s advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter
Lengthy sales and implementation cycles for WebMD s private online portals make it difficult to forecast revenues from these applications
WebMD may be unsuccessful in its efforts to increase advertising and sponsorship revenue from consumer products companies
WebMD could be subject to breach of warranty or other claims by clients of our online portals if the software and systems we use to provide them contain errors or experience failures
WebMD s Internet-based services are dependent on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure
WebMD relies on bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties and its own systems for key aspects of the process of providing products and services to its users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or WebMD s own systems could harm WebMD s business
Implementation of additions to or changes in hardware and software platforms used to deliver WebMD s online services may result in performance problems and may not provide the additional functionality that was expected
If the systems WebMD uses to provide online portals experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure, its business could suffer
WebMD faces potential liability related to the privacy and security of personal information it collects from consumers and healthcare professionals
Failure to maintain its CME accreditation could adversely affect WebMD s ability to provide online CME offerings
Government regulation and industry initiatives could adversely affect the volume of sponsored online CME programs implemented through WebMD s Web sites or require changes to how WebMD offers CME
ViPS depends on CMS for a significant portion of its revenues and, if ViPS reputation or relationship with CMS were harmed, ViPS financial results would be adversely affected
ViPS depends on being retained as a subcontractor by other CMS contractors for a significant portion of its revenues and, if ViPS reputation or relationships with CMS or such contractors were harmed, ViPS financial results would be adversely affected
CMS may modify, curtail or terminate contracts prior to their completion and, if ViPS does not replace them, its financial results may suffer
ViPS CMS contracts may be terminated and ViPS may be liable for penalties under a variety of procurement rules and regulations
ViPS is subject to routine audits and cost adjustments by CMS, which, if resolved unfavorably to ViPS, could adversely affect its profitability
Changes in government regulations or practices could adversely affect ViPS financial results
If subcontractors with which ViPS works fail to satisfy their obligations to ViPS or to the customers, ViPS reputation and financial results could be adversely affected
If ViPS systems experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure, its business could suffer
Lengthy sales, installation and implementation cycles for some ViPS applications may result in unanticipated fluctuations in its revenues
ViPS could be subject to breach of warranty, product liability or other claims if software or services it provides contain errors or do not meet contractual performance standards
ViPS HealthPayer Solutions Group depends on Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association for a significant portion of it revenue and, if its reputation or relationship with the BCBS business community were harmed, that business would be adversely affected.
Porex s success depends upon demand for its products, which in some cases ultimately depends upon end-user demand for the products of its customers
Porex s product offerings must meet changing customer requirements
Potential new or enhanced Porex products may not achieve sufficient sales to be profitable or justify the cost of their development
Porex may not be able to source the raw materials it needs or may have to pay more for those raw materials
Disruptions in Porex s manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results
Porex may not be able to keep third parties from using technology it has developed
The nature of Porex s products exposes it to product liability claims that may not be adequately covered by indemnity agreements or insurance
Economic, political and other risks associated with Porex s international sales and geographically diverse operations could adversely affect Porex s operations and financial results
Environmental regulation could adversely affect Porex s business
Risks Related to Our Investment in EBSCo
We have a minority investment in EBSCo, which is now a highly leveraged company
The financial results of EBSCo and the value of our investment in it could be adversely affected to the extent healthcare payers conduct electronic data interchange, or EDI, transactions without using a clearinghouse or if their ability to do so allows them to terminate or modify their relationships with us
The financial results of EBSCo and the value of our investment in it could be adversely affected to the extent healthcare payers and providers compete with EBS or, instead of using a third-party provider, perform internally some of the same services that EBS offers
The financial results of EBSCo and the value of our investment in it could be adversely affected if it does not maintain relationships with practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare EDI transactions
New or updated products and services of EBS will not become profitable unless they achieve sufficient levels of market acceptance
EBS s ability to provide transaction services depends on services provided by telecommunications companies
If EBS s systems experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure, its business could suffer
Performance problems with EBS s systems or system failures, whether caused by hardware, software or other problems, could cause EBS to lose business or incur liabilities
Risks Related to Providing Products and Services to the Healthcare Industry
Reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could adversely affect us
Government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to the compliance efforts and business strategies of WebMD, ViPS, Porex and EBS
Risks Applicable to Our Entire Company and to Ownership of Our Securities
The ongoing investigations by the United States Attorney for the District of South Carolina and the SEC could negatively impact our company and divert management attention from our business operations
The dispositions of Emdeon Practice Services and Emdeon Business Services may create contractual liabilities, including for indemnifications, as well as other risks and liabilities
We depend on EBS to provide us with certain services required by us for the operation of our business
If certain transactions occur with respect to our capital stock, limitations may be imposed on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to reduce our income taxes
Our success depends, in part, on our attracting and retaining qualified executives and employees
Recent and pending management changes may disrupt our operations and our ability to recruit and retain other personnel
Contractual relationships with governmental customers may impose special burdens and additional risks on us that are not generally found in contracts with other customers
We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights
Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services
We have incurred losses and may incur losses in the future
Acquisitions, business combinations and other transactions may be difficult to complete and, if completed, may have negative consequences for our business and our securityholders
Our business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or to assess the risks in particular transactions
We may not be able to raise additional funds when needed for our business or to exploit opportunities
