                    Risks related to current economic conditions
The continuation or worsening of current recessionary conditions, as well as continued turmoil in the financial markets, would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
The continuation of current recessionary conditions would likely adversely affect our lending businesses and the value of the loans and debt securities we hold.
Our regional concentration makes us particularly at risk for economic conditions in our primary retail banking footprint.
Our business and performance are vulnerable to the impact of continued volatility in debt and equity markets.

Our regional concentration makes us particularly at risk for economic conditions in our primary retail banking footprint.
Our business and performance are vulnerable to the impact of continued volatility in debt and equity markets.
Our business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which we may not be able to predict adequately.
The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.

The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
Actions taken by the federal government to stabilize the U.S. financial system and provide economic stimulus may not succeed.
Risks resulting from recent transactions
Our acquisition of National City presents substantial risks and uncertainties, which could limit our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from this transaction.
Our issuance of securities to the US Department of the Treasury may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders and is dilutive to our common shares. Also, the dividend rate increases substantially after five years if we are unable to redeem the shares by that time.

Our issuance of securities to the US Department of the Treasury may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders and is dilutive to our common shares. Also, the dividend rate increases substantially after five years if we are unable to redeem the shares by that time.
The US Department of the Treasury has the unilateral ability to change some of the restrictions imposed on us by virtue of our sale of securities to it.
Risks related to the ordinary course of PNC s business
We operate in a highly competitive environment, both in terms of the products and services we offer, the geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as our labor markets and competition for talented employees. Competition could adversely impact our customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product pricing, causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues.
We grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other financial services companies, and these acquisitions present us with a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.
The performance of our asset management businesses may be adversely affected by the relative performance of our products compared with alternative investments as well as by overall economic and market conditions.

The performance of our fund servicing business may be adversely affected by changes in investor preferences, or changes in existing or potential fund servicing clients or alternative providers.
As a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and to comprehensive examination and supervision by regulators, which affects our business as well as our competitive position.

We must comply with generally accepted accounting principles established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, accounting, disclosure and other rules set forth by the SEC, income tax and other regulations established by the US Department of the Treasury, and revenue rulings and other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, which affect our financial condition and results of operations.
The determination of the amount of loss allowances and impairments taken on our assets is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.
Our asset valuation may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by natural disasters, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.
