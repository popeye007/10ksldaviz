                    We have significant indebtedness, which has substantial debt service obligations and operating and financial covenants that constrain our ability to operate our business. Unless we are able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these debt obligations, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
In the event that we are unable to refinance at least $135 million of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes by February 2010, and are unable to negotiate an amendment or waiver, we will need to repay all of our obligations under our senior secured credit agreement, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our current credit agreement contains various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We face risks related to the current economic crisis.
We rely on indirect sales channels to market and sell our branded products. Therefore, the loss of or deterioration in our relationship with one or more of our resellers or distributors could negatively affect our operating results.
Our operating results depend on new product introductions, which may not be successful, in which case our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
A large percentage of our sales come from a few customers, some of which are also competitors, and these customers generally have no minimum or long-term purchase commitments. The loss of, or a significant reduction in demand from, one or more key customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
We derive the majority of our revenue from products incorporating tape technology. If competition from alternative storage technologies continues or increases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely harmed.
Our tape media royalties and OEM software licenses are relatively profitable, and can significantly impact total company profitability. If we were to experience a significant decline in royalty or software license revenues, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
Competition has increased and evolved, and may increasingly intensify, in the tape and disk-based storage products markets as a result of competitors introducing products based on new technology standards, and merger and acquisition activity, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have taken considerable steps towards reducing our cost structure and may take further cost reduction actions. The steps we have taken and may take in the future may not reduce our cost structure to a level appropriate in relation to our future sales and therefore, these anticipated cost reductions may be insufficient to bring us back to profitability.
We have received several notices from the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) that we did not meet its continued listing requirements. If we are unable to maintain compliance with NYSE rules, our common stock will be delisted from trading on the NYSE, which could materially and adversely impair the liquidity and value of our common stock.
Economic or other business factors may lead us to further write down the carrying amount of our goodwill or long-lived assets, such as the $339 million goodwill impairment charge taken in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
Third party intellectual property infringement claims could result in substantial liability and significant costs, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
As a result of our global manufacturing and sales operations, we are subject to a variety of risks that are unique to businesses with international operations of a similar scope, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our quarterly operating results could fluctuate significantly, and past quarterly operating results should not be used to predict future performance.
If our products fail to meet our or our customers specifications for quality and reliability, our results of operations may be adversely impacted and our competitive position may suffer.
If we do not successfully manage the changes that we have made and may continue to make to our infrastructure and management, our business could be disrupted, and that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
If we fail to protect our intellectual property or if others use our proprietary technology without authorization, our competitive position may suffer.
Because we may order components from suppliers in advance of receipt of customer orders for our products which include these components, we could face a material inventory risk.
Some of our manufacturing, component production and service repair is outsourced to third party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and service providers. If we cannot obtain products, parts and services from these third parties in a cost effective and timely manner that meets our customers expectations, this could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We do not control licensee sales of tape media cartridges. To the extent that our royalty revenue is dependent on the volumes of cartridges sold by our licensees, should these licensees significantly sell fewer media products, such decreased volumes could lower our royalty revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Our inability to attract and retain employees could adversely impact our business.
Our stock price could become more volatile if certain institutional investors were to increase or decrease the number of shares they own. In addition, there are other factors and events that could affect the trading prices of our common stock.
Our design and production processes are subject to safety and environmental regulations which could lead to increased costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to many laws and regulations, and violation of those requirements could materially and adversely affect our business.
We may be sued by our customers as a result of failures in our products.
We must maintain appropriate levels of service parts inventories. If we do not have sufficient service parts inventories, we may experience increased levels of customer dissatisfaction. If we hold excessive service parts inventories, we may incur financial losses.
Because we rely heavily on distributors and other resellers to market and sell our products, if one or more distributors were to experience a significant deterioration in its financial condition or its relationship with us, this could disrupt the distribution of our products and reduce our revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
From time to time we make acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.
If the future outcomes related to the estimates used in recording tax liabilities to various taxing authorities result in higher tax liabilities than estimated, then we would have to record tax charges, which could be material.
We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to our position in such currencies could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
