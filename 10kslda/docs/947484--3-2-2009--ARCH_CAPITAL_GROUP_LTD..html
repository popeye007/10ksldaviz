                    We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry.
The insurance and reinsurance industry is highly cyclical, and we expect to continue to experience periods characterized by excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates.
We could face unanticipated losses from war, terrorism and political instability, and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The insurance and reinsurance industry is subject to regulatory and legislative initiatives or proposals from time to time which could adversely affect our business.
Claims for catastrophic events could cause large losses and substantial volatility in our results of operations, and, as a result, the value of our securities, including our common shares and preferred shares, may fluctuate widely, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
Underwriting claims and reserving for losses are based on probabilities and related modeling, which are subject to inherent uncertainties.
The failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
The risk associated with reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us, and while reinsurance and retrocessional coverage will be used to limit our exposure to risks, the availability of such arrangements may be limited, and counterparty credit and other risks associated with our reinsurance arrangements may result in losses which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk.
We cannot predict the effect that the investigation currently being conducted by the New York Attorney General and others will have on the industry or our business, and the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and certain proposed legislation are uncertain.
Our success will depend on our ability to maintain and enhance effective operating procedures and internal controls.
A downgrade in our ratings or our inability to obtain a rating for our operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may adversely affect our relationships with clients and brokers and negatively impact sales of our products.
The loss of our key employees or our inability to retain them could negatively impact our business.
The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments, which are even more difficult than those made in a mature company since relatively limited historical information has been reported to us through December 31, 2008.
The Warburg Pincus funds own approximately 6.6% of our voting shares, and they have the right to have a director on our board; their interests may materially differ from the interests of the holders of our other securities.
The price of our common shares may be volatile.
Continued adverse developments in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and our businesses, and may also limit our access to capital; our policyholders, reinsurers and retrocessionaires may also be affected by such developments, which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.
Our business is dependent upon insurance and reinsurance brokers, and the loss of important broker relationships could materially adversely affect our ability to market our products and services.
We could be materially adversely affected to the extent that managing general agents, general agents and other producers in our program business exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us.
Our investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.
We may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions, including interest rate changes, as well as legislative changes.
The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.
We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms.
We sold our prior reinsurance operations in May 2000 and may have liability to the purchaser and continuing liability from those reinsurance operations if the purchaser should fail to make payments on the reinsurance liabilities it assumed.
We sold our non-standard automobile insurance operations and merchant banking operations in 2004 and may have liability to the purchasers.
Any future acquisitions, growth of our operations through the addition of new lines of insurance or reinsurance business through our existing subsidiaries or through the formation of new subsidiaries, expansion into new geographic regions and/or joint ventures or partnerships may expose us to operational risks.
Some of the provisions of our bye-laws and our shareholders agreement may have the effect of hindering, delaying or preventing third party takeovers or changes in management initiated by shareholders. These provisions may also prevent our shareholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover.
Our operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in various jurisdictions, and material changes in the regulation of their operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
If our Bermuda operating subsidiary becomes subject to insurance statutes and regulations in jurisdictions other than Bermuda or if there is a change in Bermuda law or regulations or the application of Bermuda law or regulations, there could be a significant and negative impact on our business.
ACGL is a holding company and is dependent on dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries, which are subject to dividend restrictions, to make payments, including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses we may incur and any payments of dividends, redemption amounts or liquidation amounts with respect to our preferred shares and common shares.
If our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary is unable to provide collateral to ceding companies, its ability to conduct business could be significantly and negatively affected.
We may become subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may adversely affect our financial results.
Certain employees of our Bermuda operations are required to obtain work permits before engaging in a gainful occupation in Bermuda. Required work permits may not be granted or may not remain in effect.
The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be difficult.
General market conditions and unpredictable factors could adversely affect market prices for our outstanding preferred shares.
Dividends on our preferred shares are non-cumulative.
Our preferred shares are equity and are subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.
The voting rights of holders of our preferred shares are limited.
There is no limitation on our issuance of securities that rank equally with or senior to our preferred shares.
A classification of any series of preferred shares by the NAIC may impact U.S. insurance companies that purchase such series.
We and our non-U.S. subsidiaries may become subject to U.S. federal income taxation.
U.S. persons who hold our common shares or preferred shares may be subject to U.S. income taxation at ordinary income rates on our undistributed earnings and profits.
Reduced tax rate for qualified dividend income received by individuals and other non-corporate holders may not be available in the future.
Our non-U.S. companies may be subject to U.K. tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
