                    Risks Related to our Business
Our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brand, and if we do not maintain and strengthen our brand, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.
If we are unable to penetrate existing markets or adapt or develop technologies and products for new markets, our business prospects could be limited.
We face significant competition in various markets, and if we are unable to compete successfully, our ability to generate revenues from our business will suffer.
We are dependent on the sale by our licensees of consumer hardware and software products that incorporate our technologies. Our top 10 licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 53% of our total net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2008, and a reduction in revenues from those licensees or a loss of one or more of our key licensees would adversely affect our licensing revenue.
Our March 2009 promotion and distribution agreement with Google may not prove to be an adequate replacement for our September 2007 agreement with Yahoo!.
The success of our business depends on the availability of premium video content in the DivX format.
The success of our business depends on the interoperability of our technologies with consumer hardware devices.
If we fail to develop and deliver innovative technologies and products in response to changes in our industry, including changes in consumer tastes or trends, our revenues could decline.
Our licensing revenue depends in large part upon integrated circuit manufacturers incorporating our technologies into their products for sale to our consumer hardware device manufacturer licensees and if our technologies are not incorporated in these integrated circuits or fewer integrated circuits are sold that incorporate our technologies, our revenues will be adversely affected.
Our business is dependent in part on technologies we license from third parties, and these license rights may be inadequate for our business.
We rely on our licensees to accurately prepare royalty reports for our determination of licensing revenues, and if these reports are inaccurate, our revenues may be under- or over-stated and our forecasts and budgets may be incorrect.
Current credit and financial market conditions could delay, or prevent consumers from purchasing products incorporating our licensed technology, which could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any development delays or cost overruns may affect our ability to respond to technological changes, competitive developments or customer requirements and expose us to other adverse consequences.
We conduct a substantial portion of our business outside North America and, as a result, we face diverse risks related to engaging in international business.
We face risks with respect to conducting business in China due to China s historically limited recognition and enforcement of intellectual property and contractual rights.
Pricing pressures on the consumer hardware device manufacturers and software vendors who incorporate our technologies into their products could limit the licensing fees we charge for our technologies and adversely affect our revenues.
We do not expect sales of DVD players to continue to grow as quickly as they have in the past. To the extent that sales of DVD players level off or decline, or alternative technologies in which we do not participate replace DVDs as a dominant medium for consumer video entertainment, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected.
Digital video technologies could be treated as a commodity in the future, which could expose us to significant pricing pressure.
Current and future government standards or standards-setting organizations may limit our business opportunities.
Our business may depend in part upon our ability to provide effective digital rights management technology.
We have offered and we expect to continue to offer some of our products and technologies for reduced prices or free of charge, and we may not realize the benefits of this marketing strategy.
Our online video communities and distribution services and platforms are rapidly evolving and may not prove viable.
We may experience changes in the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth or contraction.
We may experience changes in our senior management which may disrupt our operations.
Our business, in particular our content distribution offerings and community forums, will suffer if our systems or networks fail, become unavailable or perform poorly so that current or potential users do not have adequate access to our online products and websites.
Any failure or interruption of the services provided by bandwidth providers, data centers or other key third parties could subject our business to disruption and additional costs and damage our reputation.
Our network is subject to security risks that could harm our reputation and expose us to litigation or liability.
It is not yet clear how laws designed to protect children that use the Internet may be interpreted and enforced, and whether new similar laws will be enacted in the future which may apply to our business in ways that may subject us to potential liability.
We may be subject to market risk and legal liability in connection with the data collection capabilities of our various online services.
Improper conduct by users could subject us to claims and compliance costs.
We may be subject to legal liability for the provision of third-party products, services, content or advertising.
We may be subject to assessment of sales taxes and other taxes for our licensing of technology or sale of products.
Inflation and other unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our revenues, margins and profitability.
Failure to comply with applicable current and future government regulations could limit our ability to license our technologies, sell our products or distribute content, and expose us to additional costs and liabilities.
If we lose the services of key members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.
We rely on highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, we may not be able to maintain our operations or grow effectively.
Our recent acquisitions, as well as any companies or technologies we may acquire in the future, could prove difficult to integrate and may result in unexpected costs and disruptions to our business.
We may not realize the benefits we expect from the acquisition of MainConcept.
Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture.
Risks related to our finances
Our quarterly operating results and stock price may fluctuate significantly.
We have a history of net losses and only recently achieved profitability, and we may not be able to sustain our profitability.
We may require additional capital, and raising additional funds by issuing securities, debt financing or through strategic alliances or licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.
Our investments in auction rate securities may not provide us a liquid source of cash.
Risks related to our intellectual property
We and our licensees are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies or content in the future.
We may be unable to adequately protect the proprietary rights in our technologies and products.
We may be forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights.
Our ability to maintain and enforce our trademark rights has a large impact on our ability to prevent third party infringement of our brand and technologies.
Some software we provide may be subject to open source licenses, which may restrict how we use or distribute our software or require that we release the source code of certain products subject to those licenses.
Risks related to the securities markets and investment in our common stock
Market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.
Shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid.
Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.
We will incur increased costs as a result of changes in laws and regulations relating to corporate governance matters.
If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our stock price.
Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.
