If we fail to comply with the terms of the Corporate Integrity Agreement we entered into in September 2007, we may be subject to exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
We could be subject to further governmental investigations or actions by other third parties based on allegations of wrongdoing similar to those made by the U.S. Attorney.
Our temporary suspension of the U.S. marketing and distribution of one of our hip products has adversely affected sales growth, resulted in claims and may adversely affect our ability to compete in the hip resurfacing market in the U.S.
If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future.
