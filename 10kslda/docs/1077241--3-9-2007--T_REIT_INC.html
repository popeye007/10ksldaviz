                    Decreases in property values may reduce the amount that we receive upon a sale of our assets.
If we are unable to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and lease currently available space, if tenants default under their leases or other obligations to us during the liquidation process or if our cash flow during the liquidation is otherwise less than we expect, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced.
If we are not able to sell our remaining assets in a timely manner, we may experience severe liquidity problems, may not be able to meet our obligations to our creditors and, ultimately, may become subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
If our liquidation costs or unpaid liabilities are greater than we expect, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced.
Pursuing our plan of liquidation may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, which would lower the amount of our liquidating distributions.
Pursuing our plan of liquidation may cause us to be subject to federal income tax, which would reduce the amount of our liquidating distributions.
The sale of our assets may cause us to be subject to a 100.0% excise tax on prohibited transactions, which would reduce the amount of our liquidating distributions.
Our entity value may be adversely affected by adoption of our plan of liquidation.
There can be no assurance that our plan of liquidation will result in greater returns to our shareholders on their investment within a reasonable period of time, than our shareholders would receive through other alternatives reasonably available to us.
We have terminated our regular monthly distributions and future liquidating distributions will be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors.
Distributions by us, including liquidating distributions, may include a return of capital.
Our board of directors may amend our plan of liquidation without the shareholder approval.
We have the authority to sell our assets under terms less favorable that those assumed for the purpose of estimating our net liquidation value range.
Our plan of liquidation may lead to shareholder litigation which could result in substantial costs and distract our management.
Our officers and directors and our Advisor have conflicts of interest that differ from our shareholders as a result of the liquidation.
Distributing interests in a liquidating trust may cause our shareholders to recognize gain prior to the receipt of cash.
We do not have an executed advisory agreement, and we could lose the services of our Advisor, which may increase operating expenses, and delay or reduce our liquidating distributions.
If we are unable to retain our Officers and our Advisor is unable to retain the key executives and employees it provides to us pursuant to the Advisory Agreement with us sufficient to complete our plan of liquidation in a reasonably expeditious manner, our liquidating distributions might be delayed or reduced.
Our shareholders may not receive any profits resulting from the sale of one or more of our unconsolidated properties, or receive such profits in a timely manner, because we may provide financing to the purchaser of such property.
Our plan of liquidation has caused our accounting basis to change, which could require us to write-down our assets.
We may be unable to sell jointly held properties or our interests in limited liability companies at our expected value.
Shareholders could be liable to the extent of liquidating distributions received from us if contingent reserves are insufficient to satisfy our liabilities.
We may have underestimated the amount of prepayment fees or defeasance charges on our mortgages.
Our Advisor is entitled to a share of the distributions of the assets of the Operating Partnership upon its liquidation.
Other Risks of Our Business
The pending SEC investigation of our Advisor could result in regulatory actions against us which could negatively impact our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders.
Erroneous disclosure in the prior performance tables in our initial public offering documents could result in lawsuits or other actions against us or our Advisor which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.
We expect to incur increasingly significant costs in connection with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and we may become subject to liability for any failure to comply.
We are currently involved in litigation, which could reduce the amount of our liquidation distributions.
Due to the risks involved in the ownership of real estate, there is no guarantee of any return on our shareholders investments and our shareholders may lose some or all of their investments.
Our properties face significant competition.
We depend upon our tenants to pay rent, and their inability to pay rent may substantially reduce our revenues and cash available for distribution to our shareholders.
Lack of diversification and illiquidity of real estate may make it difficult for us to sell underperforming properties or recover our investment in one or more properties.
Lack of geographic diversity may expose us to regional economic downturns that could adversely impact our operations or our ability to recover our investment in one or more properties.
Due to the limited number of properties in our portfolio, we are dependent upon those tenants that generate significant rental income, which may have a negative impact on our financial condition if these tenants are unable to meet their rental obligations to us.
Losses for which we either could not or did not obtain insurance will adversely affect our earnings and we may be unable to comply with insurance requirements contained in mortgage or other agreements due to high insurance costs.
Our co-ownership arrangements with affiliated entities may not reflect solely our shareholders best interests and may subject these investments to increased risks.
There is currently no public market for our common stock. Therefore, it will likely be difficult for our shareholders to sell their shares and, if our shareholders are able to sell their shares in a fully liquid manner, our shareholders may elect to do so at a substantial discount from the price our shareholders paid for these matters.
Our success will be dependent on the performance of our Advisor as well as key employees of our Advisor.
Our use of borrowings to partially fund improvements on properties could result in foreclosures and unexpected debt service expenses upon refinancing, both of which could have an adverse impact on our operations and cash flow. Additionally, restrictive covenants in our loan documents may restrict our operating or acquisition activities.
The pending SEC investigation of our Advisor could result in defaults or alleged defaults under our loan documents or limit our ability to obtain debt financing in the future.
If we purchased assets at a time when the commercial real estate market was experiencing substantial influxes of capital investment and competition for properties, the real estate we purchased may not have appreciated or may have decreased in value.
Our past performance is not a predictor of our future results.
The conflicts of interest of our Advisor s officers with us mean we will not be managed by our Advisor solely in the best interests of our shareholders.
The absence of arm s length bargaining may mean that our agreements are not as favorable to our shareholders as these agreements otherwise would have been.
Risks Associated With Being a REIT
If we fail to qualify as a REIT, our shareholders could be adversely affected.
We may not be able to meet, or we may need to incur borrowings that would otherwise not be incurred to meet REIT minimum distribution requirements.
We may be harmed by changes in laws, including tax laws applicable to REITs, or the reduced 15.0% tax rate on certain corporate distributions.
Dramatic increases in insurance rates could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make liquidating distributions to our shareholders pursuant to our plan of liquidation.
