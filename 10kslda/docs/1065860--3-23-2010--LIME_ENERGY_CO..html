                    the future we cannot obtain bank financing it could limit our ability to grow our business to the point that it is profitable on a consistent basis.
The current widespread economic downturn and uncertainty and turmoil in the equity and credit markets could adversely impact our clients, diminish the demand for our services and products, and harm our operations and financial performance.
It is difficult for us to estimate our future quarterly operating results.
We operate in a highly competitive industry and if we are unable to compete successfully our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected.
We may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings.
Our success is largely dependent upon the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management
and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineers and other skilled personnel
, and the loss of their services or our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our business or to maintain profitable operations.
Our future success will depend largely on the skills, efforts, and motivation of our executive officers and other senior managers. The loss of the service of executive officers and other senior managers or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our business, implement our strategy or maintain profitable operations.
In addition, to execute our growth strategy and maintain our margins, we must attract and retain highly qualified engineers, other skilled personnel and an effective sales force that can accurately price our clients energy efficiency solution contracts. Competition for hiring these individuals is intense, especially with regard to engineers specializing in the energy efficiency solutions market. If we fail to
attract and retain highly qualified engineers and other skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.
We depend upon a limited number of clients in any given period to generate a substantial portion of our revenue.
Our public sector business depends on a limited number of ESCOs under contract by government and other public end-users.
Failure of our subcontractors to properly and effectively perform their services in a timely manner could cause delays in the delivery of our energy efficiency solutions.
If our information technology systems fail, or if we experience operation interruptions, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Product liability and personal injury claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our retrofitting process frequently involves responsibility for the removal and disposal of components containing hazardous materials and at times requires that our contractors or subcontractors work in hazardous conditions, either of which could give rise to a claim against us.
If we are unable to manage our anticipated revenue growth effectively, our operations and profitability could be adversely affected.
We intend to undertake a number of strategies in an effort to grow our revenue. If we are successful, our revenue growth may place significant strain on our limited resources. To properly manage any future revenue growth, we must continue to improve our management, operational, administrative, accounting and financial reporting systems and expand, train and manage our employee base, which may involve significant expenditures and increased operating costs. Due to our limited resources and experience, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and
adequately train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to manage our anticipated revenue growth effectively, the quality of our client care may suffer, we may experience client dissatisfaction, reduced future revenue or increased warranty claims, and our expenses could substantially and disproportionately increase. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our growth may be impaired and our current business may suffer if we do not successfully address risks associated with any future acquisitions that we may make.
Our future growth may depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully identify, acquire and operate other complementary businesses.
Our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards will be subject to additional limitation, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability.
Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock
The future trading market for our common stock may not be active on a consistent basis and the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations.
The price of our common stock may also fluctuate as a result of:
The stock markets, in general, periodically experience volatility that is sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline; in particular, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the public offering price.
In the past, following a period of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company. Because of the potential volatility of our common stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business.
Due to the concentration of holdings of our stock, a limited number of investors may be able to control matters requiring common stockholder approval or could cause our stock price to decline through future sales because they beneficially own a large percentage of our common stock.
The large concentration of our shares held by this small group of stockholders could result in increased volatility in our stock price due to the limited number of shares available in the market.
Raising additional capital or consummation of additional acquisitions through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities could dilute your ownership interest.
Provisions of our charter and by-laws, in particular our blank check preferred stock, and in the Delaware General Corporation Law may prevent or discourage an acquisition of our Company that would benefit our stockholders.
In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions, including the application of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally restricts our ability to engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of our capital stock. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.
Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and The NASDAQ Stock Market, have imposed substantial requirements
