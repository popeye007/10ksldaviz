                    Risks related to current economic conditions
The failure or slowing of the current modest economic recovery from recessionary conditions, or further turmoil or volatility in the financial markets, would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
The failure or slowing of the current modest recovery from recessionary conditions, as well as the lingering effects of the recession, would likely adversely affect our lending businesses and the value of the loans and debt securities we hold.
The failure or slowing of the current modest recovery from recessionary conditions, as well as the lingering effects of the recession, would likely adversely affect our lending businesses and the value of the loans and debt securities we hold.
Our regional concentrations make us particularly at risk for economic conditions in our primary retail banking footprint.
Our business and performance are vulnerable to the impact of continued volatility in debt and equity markets.
Our business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which we may not be able to predict adequately.

The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
Risks resulting from 2008-2010 transactions
Our acquisition of National City presents substantial risks and uncertainties, which could limit our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from this transaction.
Our failure to complete the sale of GIS by November 1, 2010 would result in a requirement that we sell other assets or raise additional common equity.
Risks related to the ordinary course of PNC s business
We operate in a highly competitive environment, both in terms of the products and services we offer, the geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as our labor markets and competition for talented employees. Competition could adversely impact our customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product pricing, causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues.

Competition could adversely impact our customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product pricing, causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues.
We grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other financial services companies, and these acquisitions present us with a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.
The performance of our asset management businesses may be adversely affected by the relative performance of our products compared with alternative investments as well as by overall economic and market conditions.
The performance of our fund servicing business may be adversely affected by changes in investor preferences, or changes in existing or potential fund servicing clients or alternative providers.
As a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and to comprehensive examination and supervision by regulators, which affects our business as well as our competitive position.
