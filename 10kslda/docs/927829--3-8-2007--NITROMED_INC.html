                    Risks Relating to our Business
Our business is substantially dependent on the commercial success of BiDil, and if we do not maintain market presence of BiDil during the development of BiDil XR, our business will be materially harmed and our stock price will decline.
Poor performance by our restructured sales force, or difficulties arising from the restructuring of our sales organization, could prevent us from achieving the results we need to maintain market presence of BiDil.
If we do not successfully market and sell BiDil, either directly through our small, restructured sales force or indirectly through third-party co-promotion arrangements, our future revenue will be limited.
If the government or third-party payors do not reimburse patients for BiDil, or do not reimburse for BiDil at favorable levels, BiDil might not be used or purchased, and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected.
Physicians, third-party payors and patients may not be receptive to BiDil, which could prevent us from achieving profitability.
The availability of lower priced generic forms of the components of BiDil may adversely affect our sales of BiDil and the pricing or reimbursement we are able to obtain for BiDil.
We will require substantial additional amounts of cash to fund our operating plan, including commercializing BiDil and seeking to develop and commercialize BiDil XR, and, if additional capital is not available, we may need to limit, scale back or cease our operations.
We do not have the internal technology to successfully develop BiDil XR and our success will depend on our ability to co-develop such technology with a collaborative partner.
We cannot be certain that clinical testing of BiDil XR will be successful, nor can we be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for BiDil XR.
The development and future commercialization of BiDil XR may be terminated or delayed, and the cost of development and future commercialization may increase, if third parties on whom we rely to manufacture BiDil XR do not fulfill their obligations.
Currently, we are engaging in limited internal research and development activities and, accordingly, our ability to generate future revenue from our nitric oxide technology portfolio is completely dependent on our ability to enter into scientifically and commercially successful out-licensing or collaborative arrangements with third parties.
Because we have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain, an investment in our common stock is highly speculative.
If the third-party manufacturer of BiDil encounters delays or difficulties in production, we may not be able to meet demand for the product and we may lose potential revenue, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
We rely on a single source supplier for one of the two active ingredients in BiDil, and the loss of this supplier could prevent us from selling BiDil, which would materially harm our business.
If our collaborative partners do not obtain and maintain the regulatory approvals required to market and sell our potential nitric-oxide based product candidates in the United States, then our business may be unsuccessful, and the market price of our stock may substantially decline.
We or our potential strategic collaborators may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in order to market and sell BiDil, or our product candidates, in foreign countries.
Even if we or our strategic partners obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed products, including BiDil, will be subject to ongoing regulatory review and oversight. If we, or our strategic partners, fail to comply with continuing United States and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market BiDil, our strategic partners could lose approvals to market our out-licensed products based on our proprietary nitric oxide technology, and our business would be seriously harmed.
If we, our third-party manufacturers or our service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell BiDil, or any potential product candidates, and harm our reputation.
If the clinical trials for any product candidates our strategic partners advance into clinical testing are not successful, these partners may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our potential product candidates.
The expiration of the research term under our collaboration agreement with Boston Scientific has resulted in the loss of potential royalty-based revenue from the collaboration and may indicate that the development of nitric oxide-enhancing stents is not viable.
If the estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary significantly.
Risks Relating to our Intellectual Property Rights
Our patent protection for BiDil, the individual components of which are available in generic form, is limited, and we may be subject to generic substitution or competition and resulting pricing pressure.
If we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries, our ability to secure out-licensing or collaborative arrangements with respect to our product candidates will be harmed, and we may not be able to operate our business profitably.
If we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings to enforce our patent rights, we would incur substantial costs and expenses, as well as substantial liability for damages, and/or we, or our strategic partners, could be required to stop product development and commercialization efforts.
We in-license a significant portion of our principal proprietary technologies, and if we fail to comply with our obligations under any of the related agreements, we could lose license rights that are necessary to commercializing BiDil and out-licensing our other product candidates.
Risks Relating to our Industry
We could be negatively impacted by the application or enforcement of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws and other federal and state anti-referral laws.
We face significant competition, which may result in others commercializing products more successfully than ours.
We may be exposed to product liability claims and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance.
Risks Relating to our Common Stock
The price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile in the future.
Insiders have substantial control over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change current management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in our company.
Substantially all of our outstanding common stock may be sold into the market at any time. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.
We may incur significant costs and suffer management distraction and reputational damage from class action litigation.
