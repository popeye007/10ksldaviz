                    WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND WILL PROBABLY INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.
IF WE, OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES, ENCOUNTER UNFORESEEN DIFFICULTIES AND CANNOT OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.
BECAUSE WE HAVE SUSTAINED LOSSES SINCE OUR INCEPTION, WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT OUR OPERATIONS WILL BE PROFITABLE.
FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH COULD PLACE STRAINS ON OUR MANAGERIAL, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.
OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR ORGANIZATION TO MATCH THE GROWTH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.
THE AVAILABILITY OF SHARES FOR SALE IN THE FUTURE COULD REDUCE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.
DELAWARE LAW AND OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT COULD DISCOURAGE OR PREVENT A POTENTIAL TAKEOVER OF ACACIA RESEARCH CORPORATION THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE RESULT IN OUR STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVING A PREMIUM OVER THE MARKET PRICE OF THEIR SHARES.
WE MAY INCUR INCREASED COSTS AS A RESULT OF RECENTLY ENACTED AND PROPOSED CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS.
WE ARE PLANNING TO REDEEM ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF AR-COMBIMATRIX STOCK FOR ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION, AND FOLLOWING THE REDEMPTION, THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP WILL CEASE TO BE A PART OF ACACIA RESEARCH CORPORATION.
AS A RESULT OF THE REDEMPTION OF AR-COMBIMATRIX STOCK FOR THE COMMON STOCK OF COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION, ACACIA RESEARCH CORPORATION AND COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TAX LIABILITY UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
FOLLOWING THE REDEMPTION OF AR-COMBIMATRIX STOCK FOR THE COMMON STOCK OF COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION, ACACIA RESEARCH CORPORATION AND COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TAX LIABILITY UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE FOR ACTIONS TAKEN BY EITHER OF THEM FOLLOWING THE REDEMPTION.
ACACIA RESEARCH CORPORATION AND COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION MAY BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER FOR TAX LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE REDEMPTION OF AR-COMBIMATRIX STOCK FOR THE COMMON STOCK OF COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION, WHICH MAY INTERFERE WITH BOTH COMPANIES ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN DESIRABLE STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS AND ISSUE THEIR EQUITY SECURITIES.
RISKS RELATING TO THE ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP
BECAUSE OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO MANY UNCONTROLLABLE OUTSIDE INFLUENCES, WE MAY NOT SUCCEED.
THE ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP HAS INCURRED LOSSES IN THE PAST AND EXPECTS TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.
THE ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP MAY FAIL TO MEET MARKET EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE OF FLUCTUATIONS IN ITS QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF ACACIA RESEARCH-ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE.
THE ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP S REVENUES WILL BE UNPREDICTABLE, AND THIS MAY HARM ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION.
THE ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP DEPENDS UPON RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY-BASED OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN DEVELOP INTO PROFITABLE ROYALTY-BEARING LICENSES, AND IF IT IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN AND GENERATE NEW RELATIONSHIPS, THEN IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN EXISTING LEVELS OF REVENUE OR INCREASE REVENUE.
TECHNOLOGY COMPANY STOCK PRICES ARE ESPECIALLY VOLATILE, AND THIS VOLATILITY MAY DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR ACACIA RESEARCH-ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES COMMON STOCK.
THE MARKETS SERVED BY THE ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND IF THE ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AND ACQUIRE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PATENTS, ITS REVENUES COULD STOP GROWING OR COULD DECLINE.
THE SUCCESS OF OUR ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP DEPENDS IN PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN THE BEST LEGAL COUNSEL TO REPRESENT US IN PATENT ENFORCEMENT LITIGATION.
THE ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, RELIES ON REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND OPINIONS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES, THAT IF DETERMINED TO BE FALSE OR INACCURATE, MAY EXPOSE THE ACACIA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP TO CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL.
RISKS RELATING TO THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP
OUR COMBIMATRIX GROUP WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS CASH REQUIREMENTS BEYOND THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WITHOUT OBTAINING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES, AND IF IT IS UNABLE TO DO SO, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS.
THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.
THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN AR-COMBIMATRIX STOCK PRICE COULD RESULT IN A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION.
WE ARE PLANNING TO REDEEM ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF AR-COMBIMATRIX STOCK FOR ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION, AND FOLLOWING THE REDEMPTION, HOLDERS OF AR-COMBIMATRIX STOCK WILL NO LONGER BE STOCKHOLDERS OF ACACIA RESEARCH CORPORATION.
FOLLOWING THE REDEMPTION OF AR-COMBIMATRIX STOCK FOR THE COMMON STOCK OF COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION, HOLDERS OF THE COMMON STOCK OF COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING NEW RISKS:
BECAUSE OUR COMBIMATRIX GROUP BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO MANY UNCONTROLLABLE OUTSIDE INFLUENCES, IT MAY NOT SUCCEED.
THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP MAY HAVE TO ENTER INTO NEW STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS TO GENERATE REVENUE CONSISTENT WITH ITS OPERATING HISTORY OF WORKING WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS SUCH AS ROCHE DIAGNOSTICS GmbH.
THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP MAY FAIL TO MEET MARKET EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE OF FLUCTUATIONS IN ITS QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE ITS STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.
THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S REVENUES WILL BE UNPREDICTABLE, AND THIS MAY HARM ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION.
TECHNOLOGY COMPANY STOCK PRICES ARE ESPECIALLY VOLATILE, AND THIS VOLATILITY MAY DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR AR-COMBIMATRIX STOCK.
THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP IS DEPLOYING NEW AND UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES WHICH MAKES EVALUATION OF ITS BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS DIFFICULT, AND IT MAY BE FORCED TO CEASE OPERATIONS IF IT DOES NOT DEVELOP COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS.
THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE, AND IF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP MAY HAVE TO CURTAIL OR CEASE OPERATIONS.
IF THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP DOES NOT ENTER INTO SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER COMPANIES, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY DEVELOP ITS TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS, AND ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE HARMED.
THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP HAS LIMITED EXPERIENCE COMMERCIALLY MANUFACTURING, MARKETING OR SELLING ANY OF ITS POTENTIAL PRODUCTS, AND UNLESS IT DEVELOPS THESE CAPABILITIES, IT MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.
THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP FACES INTENSE COMPETITION AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL COMPETING IN THE MARKET.
IF THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S NEW AND UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGY IS NOT USED BY RESEARCHERS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL, BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ACADEMIC COMMUNITIES, ITS BUSINESS WILL SUFFER.
IF THE MARKET FOR ANALYSIS OF GENOMIC INFORMATION DOES NOT DEVELOP OR IF GENOMIC INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, ITS BUSINESS WILL NOT SUCCEED.
IF THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, SUCH AS INSURANCE COMPANIES, MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND MEDICARE, DO NOT PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THEIR COMMERCIAL VIABILITY MAY BE LIMITED.
OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY BE HINDERED SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO GAIN ACCESS TO PATIENTS TISSUE AND BLOOD SAMPLES.
IF OUR CURRENT LABORATORY FACILITY BECOMES INOPERABLE OR LOSES CERTIFICATION, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO PERFORM OUR TESTS AND OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED.
WE COULD FACE SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES IF WE WERE SUED FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY.
THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF ITS ENGINEERING, TECHNICAL AND KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND ITS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, HIRE AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING, TECHNICAL AND KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL.
THE EXPANSION OF THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S PRODUCT LINES MAY SUBJECT IT TO REGULATION BY THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD PREVENT OR DELAY ITS INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS.
AS THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S OPERATIONS EXPAND, ITS COSTS TO COMPLY WITH
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL INCREASE, AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD HARM ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS.
THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S BUSINESS DEPENDS ON ISSUED AND PENDING PATENTS, AND THE LOSS OF ANY PATENTS OR THE GROUP'S FAILURE TO SECURE THE ISSUANCE OF PATENTS COVERING ELEMENTS OF ITS BUSINESS PROCESSES WOULD MATERIALLY HARM ITS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
ANY INABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES COULD MATERIALLY HARM THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S COMPETITIVE POSITION AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.
ANY LITIGATION TO PROTECT THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR ANY THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT, COULD DIVERT SUBSTANTIAL TIME AND MONEY FROM THE COMBIMATRIX GROUP'S BUSINESS AND COULD SHUT DOWN SOME OF ITS OPERATIONS.
A FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF COMBIMATRIX CORPORATION HAS FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ALLEGING THAT HE WAS WRONGFULLY TERMINATED.
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY SELLING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT OUR OPERATIONS WILL BE PROFITABLE.
FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH COULD PLACE STRAINS ON OUR MANAGERIAL, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.
OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR ORGANIZATION TO MATCH THE GROWTH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.
