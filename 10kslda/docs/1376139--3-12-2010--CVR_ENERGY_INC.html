                    Our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate for our capital needs.
If we are required to obtain our crude oil supply without the benefit of a crude oil supply agreement, our exposure to the risks associated with volatile crude oil prices may increase and our liquidity may be reduced.
Disruption of our ability to obtain an adequate supply of crude oil could reduce our liquidity and increase our costs.
If our access to the pipelines on which we rely for the supply of our feedstock and the distribution of our products is interrupted, our inventory and costs may increase and we may be unable to efficiently distribute our products.
Our petroleum business financial results are seasonal and generally lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year, which may cause volatility in the price of our common stock.
We face significant competition, both within and outside of our industry. Competitors who produce their own supply of feedstocks, have extensive retail outlets, make alternative fuels or have greater financial resources than we do may have a competitive advantage over us.
Changes in our credit profile may affect our relationship with our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to operate our refineries at full capacity.
Risks Related to Our Nitrogen Fertilizer Business
Natural gas prices affect the price of the nitrogen fertilizers that the nitrogen fertilizer business sells. Any decline in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The nitrogen fertilizer plant has high fixed costs. If nitrogen fertilizer product prices fall below a certain level, which could be caused by a reduction in the price of natural gas, the nitrogen fertilizer business may not generate sufficient revenue to operate profitably or cover its costs.
The nitrogen fertilizer business is cyclical and volatile. Historically, periods of high demand and pricing have been followed by periods of declining prices and declining capacity utilization. Such cycles expose us to potentially significant fluctuations in our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, which could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.
The nitrogen fertilizer business faces intense competition from other nitrogen fertilizer producers.
Adverse weather conditions during peak fertilizer application periods may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and the ability of the nitrogen fertilizer business to make cash distributions, because the agricultural customers of the nitrogen fertilizer business are geographically concentrated.
The nitrogen fertilizer business is seasonal, which may result in our carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital, and the inability to predict future seasonal nitrogen fertilizer demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages.
The nitrogen fertilizer business results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by the supply and price levels of pet coke and other essential raw materials.
The nitrogen fertilizer business results of operations are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry where our customers operate. These factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability.
Ammonia can be very volatile and dangerous. Any liability for accidents involving ammonia that cause severe damage to property and/or injury to the environment and human health could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the nitrogen fertilizer business. In addition, the costs of transporting ammonia could increase significantly in the future.
The nitrogen fertilizer business relies on third party providers of transportation services and equipment, which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the nitrogen fertilizer business.
Environmental laws and regulations on fertilizer end-use and application could have a material adverse impact on fertilizer demand in the future.
A major factor underlying the current high level of demand for the nitrogen fertilizer business nitrogen-based fertilizer products is the expanding production of ethanol. A decrease in ethanol production, an increase in ethanol imports or a shift away from corn as a principal raw material used to produce ethanol could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the nitrogen fertilizer business.
Risks Related to Our Entire Business
Instability and volatility in the capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our refinery and nitrogen fertilizer facilities face operating hazards and interruptions, including unscheduled maintenance or downtime. We could face potentially significant costs to the extent these hazards or interruptions are not fully covered by our existing insurance coverage. Insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so, may change the coverage provided or may substantially increase premiums in the future.
Environmental laws and regulations could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remain in compliance or to remediate current or future contamination that could give rise to material liabilities.
Greenhouse gas emissions and proposed climate change laws and regulations could adversely affect our performance.
We are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding employee and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability.
Both the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses depend on significant customers and the loss of one or several significant customers may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
The acquisition strategy of our petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business involves significant risks.
We are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for our cash flow.
Our significant indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
A substantial portion of our workforce is unionized and we are subject to the risk of labor disputes and adverse employee relations, which may disrupt our business and increase our costs.
Our business may suffer if any of our key senior executives or other key employees discontinues employment with us. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our labor force may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity.
New regulations concerning the transportation of hazardous chemicals, risks of terrorism and the security of chemical manufacturing facilities could result in higher operating costs.
We are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, qualify for, and are relying on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.
Compliance with and changes in the tax laws could adversely affect our performance.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
The Goldman Sachs Funds and the Kelso Funds control us and may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders. Conflicts of interest may arise because our principal stockholders or their affiliates have continuing agreements and business relationships with us.
Shares eligible for future sale may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
Risks Related to the Limited Partnership Structure Through Which We Hold Our Interest in the Nitrogen Fertilizer Business
There are risks associated with the limited partnership structure through which we hold our interest in the Nitrogen Fertilizer Business. Some of these risks include:
Our rights to receive distributions from the Partnership may be limited over time.
The managing general partner of the Partnership has a fiduciary duty to favor the interests of its owners, and these interests may differ from, or conflict with, our interests and the interests of our stockholders.
The Fertilizer GP can require us to purchase its managing general partner interest in the Partnership. We may not have requisite funds to do so.
If we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions would make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may in the future be required to sell some or all of our partnership interests in order to avoid being deemed an investment company, and such sales could result in gains taxable to the company.
