                    We are a development stage company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
We may not be able to consummate an initial business combination within the required time frame, in which case, we would be forced to liquidate our assets.
Recent turmoil across various sectors of the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to complete a business combination.
If we are forced to liquidate before an initial business combination and distribute the trust account, our public stockholders may receive less than 10.00 per share and our warrants will expire worthless.
If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination, our public stockholders will be forced to wait the full 24 months before receiving liquidation distributions.
You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies.
Because there are numerous companies with a business plan similar to ours seeking to effectuate an initial business combination, it may be more difficult for us to do so.
If the net proceeds of our initial public offering not being held in trust are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least 24 months, we may be unable to complete an initial business combination.
We may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising conversion rights.
A decline in interest rates could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our consummation of an initial business combination since we depend on interest earned on the trust account to fund our search, to pay our tax obligations and to complete our initial business combination.
If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share liquidation price received by stockholders may be less than approximately 9.72 per share.
Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.
An effective registration statement may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise his, her or its warrants and causing such warrants to expire worthless.
An investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of common stock upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.
If the private placement of our sponsors warrants was not conducted in compliance with applicable law, our sponsors may have the right to rescind their warrant purchases. Their rescission rights, if any, may require us to refund an aggregate of 4,625,000 to our sponsors, thereby reducing the amount in the trust account available to us to consummate a business combination, or, in the event we do not complete a business combination within the period prescribed by our initial public offering, the amount available to our public stockholders upon our liquidation.
The investment management business is intensely competitive which may make it difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination or generate attractive returns.
The reputation of the alternative asset management industry could be adversely affected by regulatory compliance failures, the potential adverse effect of changes in laws and regulations applicable to our business and effects of negative publicity surrounding the hedge fund industry in general.
Your only opportunity to evaluate and affect the investment decision regarding a potential initial business combination will be limited to voting for or against the initial business combination submitted to our stockholders for approval.
We may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to complete an initial business combination. Issuances of our capital stock would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and may cause a change in control of our ownership, while the issuance of debt securities may have a significant impact on our ability to utilize our available cash.
Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.
Our ability to successfully effect an initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following an initial business combination.
Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following an initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.
Our officers and directors interests in obtaining reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them may lead to a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for an initial business combination and in the public stockholders best interest.
Our officers and directors allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate an initial business combination.
Certain of our executive officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
Certain of our directors and entities affiliated with certain of our directors and executive officers, own shares of our common stock issued prior to the offering and some of them own warrants. These shares and warrants will not participate in liquidation distributions and, therefore, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for an initial business combination.
The NYSE Alternext US may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
It is likely that we will only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our initial public offering, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services.
The ability of our stockholders to exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.
We may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete an initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.
Our initial stockholders, including our officers and directors, control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.
We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.
Our outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to effect an initial business combination.
If our initial stockholders, our sponsors or their permitted transferees exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
We may effect an initial business combination with a company located outside of the United States, which would subject us to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.
We may effect an initial business combination with a company located outside of the United States, therefore, the laws applicable to such company will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.
If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete an initial business combination.
Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may not be able to complete an initial business combination with some prospective target businesses.
Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.
