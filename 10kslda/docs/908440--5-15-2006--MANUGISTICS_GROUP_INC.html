                    RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER
IF OUR PROPOSED MERGER WITH JDA SOFTWARE GROUP, INC. IS NOT CONSUMMATED, OUR STOCK PRICE, BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE HARMED.
PROVISIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT MAY DETER ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.
THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
OUR INDEBTEDNESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.
WE MAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS.
IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED, WE MAY CHOOSE TO EXCHANGE THE NOTES FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET OR PURCHASE A PORTION OF THE NOTES FOR CASH, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY DILUTE EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS OR COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.
WE MAY VIOLATE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DETERIORATION OF DEMAND IN THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND COULD FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
WE BELIEVE OUR RECENT PERFORMANCE WAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CAUTIOUS CAPITAL SPENDING, CONCERNS ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. IF WE CANNOT OVERCOME THESE DIFFICULTIES OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.
IF OUR STOCK PRICE DECREASES TO LEVELS SUCH THAT THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF OUR COMPANY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.
OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VARIOUS SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH CHARGES, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE.
IF OUR EXIT AND DISPOSAL PLANS AND OUR COST CONTAINMENT AND COST REDUCTION MEASURES FAIL TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULTS OR RESULT IN UNANTICIPATED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, WE MAY SUFFER MATERIAL HARM TO OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
IF WE FAIL TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A QUALIFIED WORKFORCE, OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FURTHER, OUR COST CONTAINMENT AND COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES MAY HINDER OR IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS.
WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE SUCCESS AND GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER IF WE EXPERIENCE TOO MANY CHANGES IN KEY PERSONNEL IN TOO SHORT A PERIOD OF TIME.
WE HAVE RESTRUCTURED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE RESTRUCTURE, OUR SALES FORCE, WHICH CAN BE DISRUPTIVE. WE HAVE ALSO REDUCED OUR SALES FORCE AND CONSOLIDATED OUR SALES OFFICES AS PART OF OUR COST CONTAINMENT AND COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES. OUR FAILURE TO FIELD AN EFFECTIVE SALES ORGANIZATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
SALES CYCLES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CAN BE LONG AND UNPREDICTABLE. VARIATIONS IN THE TIME IT TAKES US TO LICENSE OUR SOFTWARE MAY CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS.
AN INCREASE IN SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT REQUIRE CUSTOMIZATION WOULD RESULT IN REVENUE BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT FOR THOSE PRODUCTS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR MARGINS AND SERVICE RATES FOR IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
CHANGES IN THE SIZE OR NUMBER OF OUR SOFTWARE TRANSACTIONS MAY CAUSE MATERIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS.
OUR ANNUAL SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE HAS DECLINED SINCE FISCAL 2003. LOWER SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE HAS RESULTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN REDUCED SERVICES AND SUPPORT REVENUE.
FURTHER DECLINES IN SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE, A REDUCTION IN THE RENEWAL RATE OF ANNUAL SUPPORT CONTRACTS, OR BOTH, COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
OUR MARKETS ARE VERY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.
INCREASED COMPETITION HAS RESULTED IN, AND IN THE FUTURE COULD RESULT IN, PRICE REDUCTIONS, LOWER GROSS MARGINS, LONGER SALES CYCLES AND THE LOSS OF MARKET SHARE. EACH OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MANY OF OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES THAN WE DO, AND THEREFORE, WE MAY BE AT A DISADVANTAGE IN COMPETING WITH THEM.
IF THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FAILS TO KEEP PACE WITH OUR INDUSTRY S RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN OUR MARKETS AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.
OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING REGULATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE THAT HAS INCREASED BOTH OUR COSTS AND THE RISK OF NONCOMPLIANCE.
IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ACCURATELY OR PREVENT FRAUD. AS A RESULT, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE HARMED AND INVESTORS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.
OUR CONTINUED SHIFT OF OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS TO INDIA POSES SIGNIFICANT RISKS.
DEFECTS IN OUR SOFTWARE, THE IMPROPER SCOPING OF A PROJECT, OR PROBLEMS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SOFTWARE COULD LEAD TO CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES BY OUR CLIENTS, LOSS OF REVENUE OR DELAYS IN THE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR SOLUTIONS.
WE UTILIZE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE THAT WE INCORPORATE INTO AND INCLUDE WITH OUR PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS. IMPAIRED RELATIONS WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES, DEFECTS IN THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE OR THEIR INABILITY OR FAILURE TO ENHANCE THEIR SOFTWARE OVER TIME COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
WE UTILIZE THIRD PARTIES TO INTEGRATE OUR SOFTWARE WITH OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS. IF ANY OF THESE THIRD PARTIES SHOULD CEASE TO PROVIDE INTEGRATION SERVICES TO US, OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.
OUR INABILITY TO DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH VENDORS SUCH AS SOFTWARE COMPANIES, CONSULTING FIRMS, RESELLERS AND OTHERS TO MARKET AND IMPLEMENT OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO COST AND OTHER AUDITS BY THE GOVERNMENT AND TERMINATIONS FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT IS HIGHLY REGULATED, AND CONTRACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF PROTESTS, CLAIMS, PENALTIES, FINES, DEFAULT TERMINATION, AND RESCISSION, AMONG OTHER ACTIONS. THE ADVERSE RESULT OF A GOVERNMENT AUDIT OR ACTION AGAINST ANY OF OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
Government contracts face special risks due to potential audits by government agencies.
Government contracts are subject to unique risks of early termination.
Competitive bidding, a cornerstone to government contracting, imposes risks and costs.
Our work with other contractors poses risks, including risks to our reputation.
Despite careful precautions that we take, we are exposed to risk due to potential employee misconduct in the highly regulated government marketplace.
The government marketplace has a unique risk: that appropriations to fund contracts will not be made, or will be diverted or delayed.
Federal contracts are subject to unique terms and risks, not commonly found in the commercial marketplace.
Our federal contracts pose unique pricing risks.
THE LIMITED ABILITY OF LEGAL PROTECTIONS TO SAFEGUARD OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.
OUR PRODUCTS MAY INFRINGE UPON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR UNEXPECTED COSTS OR PREVENT US FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCTS.
OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS POSE RISKS FOR OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, IN RELATION TO THE CURRENCIES OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE WE TRANSACT BUSINESS, COULD HARM OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE LIABILITY CLAIMS, AND THE REPUTATIONS OF OUR COMPANY AND PRODUCTS MAY SUFFER.
WE MAY CHOOSE TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR OUR EARNINGS MAY BE AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS.
IT MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN INSURANCE.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK
OUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE. SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN OUR STOCK PRICE MAY RESULT FOR VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING POOR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.
OUR CHARTER, BYLAWS AND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN, DELAWARE LAW AND THE INDENTURE FOR THE NOTES CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT COULD DISCOURAGE A TAKEOVER EVEN IF BENEFICIAL TO SHAREHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR CURRENT OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND AN ENTITY AFFILIATED WITH A DIRECTOR TOGETHER MAY BE ABLE TO EXERCISE SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OVER MATTERS REQUIRING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.
FUTURE SALES OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.
