                    If clinical trials of our current or future product candidates do not produce results necessary to support regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere, we will be unable to commercialize these products.
Because the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, IV APAP, Omigard or any other product candidate we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.
Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.
We expect intense competition in the territories in which we have rights to our product candidates, and new products may emerge that provide different or better therapeutic alternatives for our targeted indications.
If any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenues that we generate from their sales will be limited.
The decreasing use of the comparator product in our clinical trial for Omigard may limit our ability to complete the trial in a timely manner and hinder the competitive profile of this product candidate.
Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.
Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval in the United States, we may never receive approval or commercialize our products outside of the United States.
We have never marketed a drug before, and if we are unable to establish an effective sales and marketing infrastructure, we will not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates.
Our product candidates may have undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization.
If the government or third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate coverage and payment rates for our future products, if any, or if hospitals choose to use therapies that are less expensive, our revenue and prospects for profitability will be limited.
If we breach any of the agreements under which we license rights to our product candidates from others, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
If BMS breaches the underlying agreement under which we sublicense the rights to our IV APAP product candidate, we could lose the ability to develop and commercialize IV APAP.
We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, including our ongoing Phase III clinical program for IV APAP and our ongoing Phase III clinical trial for Omigard. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates on our anticipated timeline or at all.
If the manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our product candidates in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of, or be unable to meet demand for, our products and may lose potential revenues.
Our future growth depends on our ability to identify and acquire or in-license products and if we do not successfully identify and acquire or in-license related product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.
We will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.
We may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.
We face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.
Recent proposed legislation may permit re-importation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the United States, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and our overall financial condition.
Our business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.
Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property
The patent rights that we have in-licensed covering IV APAP are limited to a specific intravenous formulation of acetaminophen, and our market opportunity for this product candidate may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active ingredient itself and other formulations that may be developed by competitors.
The patent rights that we have in-licensed covering Omigard are limited in scope and limited to specific territories.
We depend on our licensors for the maintenance and enforcement of our intellectual property and have limited control, if any, over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf.
Because it is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, we may not be able to ensure their protection.
If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in any litigation would harm our business.
We may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.
Risks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements
We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.
We currently have no source of revenue and may never be profitable.
Our short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
We will need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
Raising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.
We will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.
Risks Relating to Securities Markets and Investment in Our Stock
There may not be a viable public market for our common stock.
Future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.
We expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially.
Our executive officers and directors and their affiliates may exercise control over stockholder voting matters in a manner that may not be in the best interests of all of our stockholders.
Anti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
We have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
