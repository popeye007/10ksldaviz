                    Risks Related to Our Business
We are dependent on the success of Hematide, and we cannot give any assurance that it will receive regulatory approval. Recent safety concerns surrounding the use of ESAs may limit the ability to develop or successfully commercialize Hematide.
We have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future requiring substantial additional financing. If we fail to obtain additional financing, we will be unable to complete the development and commercialization of Hematide and may need to cease operations. Even if we obtain additional financing, we may never achieve or sustain profitability
A portion of our investments consists of auction rate securities, or ARS, and the market for those securities has recently failed to provide liquidity, and if such illiquidity continues, may negatively impact our operations. Although we have received ARS rights from UBS AG, we may not be able to recover the value of our ARS under our settlement with UBS AG.
Our commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of Hematide among physicians, patients, health care payors and, in the renal market, acceptance by the major operators of dialysis clinics.
Competition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense. If our competitors are able to develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less costly than Hematide, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.
The U.S. market opportunity for Hematide may deteriorate significantly after the entry of biosimilars in the U.S.
Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials or the submission of our NDA for Hematide could severely harm our business.
Hematide is our only product candidate and we may not develop any other product candidates for the foreseeable future.
The success of Hematide is dependent upon the strength and performance of our collaboration with Takeda. If we fail to maintain our existing collaboration with Takeda, such termination would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to develop Hematide and our business. If we fail to enter into new, strategic collaborations with other future product candidates we pursue, we may have to reduce or delay our product candidate development efforts or increase our expenditures.
Reimbursement may not be available for Hematide, which would materially diminish our sales and our ability to sell our products profitably.
CMS policies are constantly changing and we cannot guarantee that they will not decrease, limit or deny reimbursement of Hematide in the future.
Medicare reimbursement policies under a new bundled payment system could create disincentives for use of ESAs.
We rely on third parties to conduct preclinical and clinical trials for Hematide, and if they do not properly and successfully perform their obligations to us, we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals.
Significant challenges remain with us and Takeda to manufacture Hematide on a commercial scale. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply may cause delays in, or prevent us from, successfully developing and commercializing Hematide. In accordance with the terms of our collaboration, Takeda has responsibility for manufacture of finished product and as a consequence, we have limited ability to control risks associated with that portion of the manufacturing process.
The commercial success of Hematide depends in part on the development and marketing efforts of Takeda, over which we have limited control. If our collaborations are unsuccessful, our ability to develop and commercialize products through our collaborations, and to generate future revenue from the sale of these products, would be significantly reduced.
It is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.
We expect to incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use, our technology.
If we are unable either to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize Hematide successfully.
If we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize Hematide or any other future product candidates.
As we evolve from a company primarily involved in research and development to a company also involved in commercialization, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.
Our operations may be adversely impacted by our exposure to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.
Risks Related to Our Industry
The regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or our collaboration partners from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of Hematide.
Even if we receive regulatory approval for Hematide, we will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize Hematide.
Failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products abroad through our Takeda collaboration.
Foreign governments often impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.
We may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.
If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of Hematide.
Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock
The market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and is likely to remain highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price.
Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.
We are at risk of securities class action litigation.
Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
