                    Risks Related to Our Business
We are a company with limited sources of revenue, and we are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidate Difimicin and, to a lesser degree, our other lead product candidate Prulifloxacin.
We have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.
If we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of Difimicin, Prulifloxacin and other product candidates, or continue our other research and development programs.
We do not currently have sufficient resources to develop and commercialize Difimicin on our own. If we are unable to find a collaboration partner or are unable to effectively collaborate with one or more partners for the development and commercialization of Difimicin, we will not generate sufficient revenues from sales of Difimicin and our business will be materially harmed.
If we are unable to obtain FDA approval of our product candidates, we will not be able to commercialize them in the United States.
Clinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.
Delays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any such delays could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to achieve regulatory approval and commence product sales as currently contemplated.
We may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to adverse events, adverse side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of our product candidates.
We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we and our collaborators may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.
If we fail to gain and maintain approval from regulatory authorities in international markets for Difimicin and any future product candidates for which we have rights in international markets, our market opportunities will be limited.
We currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing drug products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenues.
We may not be able to adequately build our own marketing and sales capabilities or enter into acceptable agreements to market and commercialize Difimicin successfully in international markets.
If our product candidates are unable to compete effectively with branded and generic antibiotics, our commercial opportunity would be reduced or eliminated.
We currently depend, and will in the future continue to depend, on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, including Difimicin and Prulifloxacin. If these manufacturers fail to provide us and our collaborators with adequate supplies of clinical trial materials and commercial product or neglect to comply with the requirements of regulatory authorities, we may be unable to develop or commercialize our products.
The commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon attaining significant market acceptance of these product candidates among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community.
If we fail to develop and commercialize other products or product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business.
Our future growth depends on our ability to identify and acquire or in-license products. If we do not successfully identify and acquire or in-license related product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.
If we do not find collaborators for our future product candidates, we may be required to reduce or delay our rate of product development and commercialization and/or increase our expenditures.
Our ability to pursue the development and commercialization of Prulifloxacin, our other product candidates and our future product candidates depends upon the continuation of our licenses from third parties.
If product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.
Even if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing significant regulatory obligations and oversight.
If we fail to attract and retain senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates.
We will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.
Third-party payor coverage and reimbursement may be insufficient or unavailable altogether for our product candidates, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Recent proposed legislation may permit re-importation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the United States, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and our overall financial condition.
Current healthcare laws and regulations and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably.
We must comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws, and, if we are unable to fully comply with such laws, we could face substantial penalties, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.
Our business and operations would suffer in the event of computer, telecommunications or other system failure.
Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
It is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.
We may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to our patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights, and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use, our technology.
Risks Related to the Securities Market and Ownership of Our Common Stock
The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile.
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to decline.
Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.
We will incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.
Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
