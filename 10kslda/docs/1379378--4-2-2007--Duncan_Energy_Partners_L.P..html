                    Risks Inherent in Our Business
Changes in demand for and production of hydrocarbon products may materially adversely
affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
A decrease in demand for natural gas, NGLs, NGL products or petrochemical products by
the petrochemical, refining or heating industries could materially adversely affect
our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
Any decrease in supplies of natural gas could adversely affect our business and
operating results. Because of the natural decline in gas production from existing
wells, our success depends on our ability to obtain access to new sources of natural
gas, which is dependent on factors beyond our control.
In accordance with industry practice, we do not obtain independent evaluations of
natural gas reserves dedicated to our pipeline systems, including our DEP South Texas NGL
Pipeline System. Accordingly, volumes of natural gas gathered on our pipeline systems in
the future could be less than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our cash
flow and our ability to make cash distributions to unitholders.
We face competition from third parties in our midstream energy businesses.
Our debt level may limit our flexibility to obtain additional financing and pursue
We may not be able to fully execute our growth strategy if we encounter illiquid capital markets or increased competition for investment opportunities.
Our revolving credit facility contains operating and financial restrictions,
including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond our
control, that may limit our business and financing activities.
Restrictions in our revolving credit facility could limit our ability to make
distributions upon the occurrence of certain events.
Increases in interest rates could materially adversely affect our business, results
of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Our growth strategy may adversely affect our results of operations if we do not successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire or if we substantially increase our indebtedness and contingent liabilities to make acquisitions.
We may not be able to make acquisitions or to make acquisitions on economically
acceptable terms, which may limit our ability to grow.
Acquisitions that appear to be accretive may nevertheless reduce our cash from
operations on a per unit basis.
We depend in large part on Enterprise Products Partners and the continued
success of its business as we operate our assets as part of their value chain, and
adverse changes in its related businesses may reduce our revenue, earnings or cash
The credit and risk profile of our general partner and its owners could adversely
affect our credit ratings and risk profile, which could increase our borrowing costs
or hinder our ability to raise capital.
A natural disaster, catastrophe or other event could result in severe personal
injury, property damage and environmental damage, which could curtail our operations
and otherwise materially adversely affect our cash flow and, accordingly, affect
the market price of our common units.
Our construction of new assets is subject to regulatory, environmental, political,
legal and economic risks, which may result in delays, increased costs or decreased
Federal, state or local regulatory measures could materially affect our business,
results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Our partnership status may be a disadvantage to us in calculating our cost of service
Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could
materially affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Our pipeline integrity program may impose significant costs and liabilities on us.
We are subject to strict regulations at many of our facilities regarding employee
safety, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our
ability to make distributions to our unitholders.
We depend on Enterprise Products Partners and certain other key customers for a
significant portion of our revenues. The loss of any of these key customers could
result in a decline in our revenues and cash available to make distributions to our unitholders.
We are exposed to the credit risks of our key customers, and any material nonpayment
or nonperformance by our key customers could reduce our ability to make
We depend on the leadership and involvement of Dan L. Duncan and other key personnel
for the success of our and our subsidiaries businesses.
Successful development of LNG import terminals outside our areas of operations could
reduce the demand for our services.
We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located,
which could disrupt our operations.
Mergers among our customers or competitors could result in lower volumes being
shipped on our pipelines, thereby reducing the amount of cash we generate.
Because of our lack of asset and geographic diversification, adverse developments in
our pipeline operations would reduce our ability to make distributions to our
Terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or our customers facilities could
adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial
Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us
Enterprise Products Partners, EPCO and their affiliates may compete with us, and
business opportunities may be directed by contract to those affiliates prior to us
under the administrative services agreement.
Our general partner and its affiliates own a controlling interest in us and have
conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary duties, which may permit them to favor
their own interests to your detriment.
We may be limited in our ability to consummate transactions, including acquisitions
with affiliates of our general partner.
EPCO s employees may be subjected to conflicts in managing our business and the allocation of time and compensation costs between our business and the business of EPCO and its other affiliates.
An affiliate of Enterprise Products Partners has the power to appoint and
remove our directors and management.
Our general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their common
units at an undesirable time or price.
Our partnership agreement limits our general partner s fiduciary duties to
unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by
our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.
Unitholders have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general
partner or its directors, which could lower the trading price of our common units.
We may issue additional units without our unitholders approval, which would dilute our unitholders
Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or
more of our common units.
We have a holding company structure in which our subsidiaries conduct our operations
and own our operating assets, which may affect our ability to make distributions to
We do not have the same flexibility as other types of organizations to accumulate
cash and equity to protect against illiquidity in the future.
Cost reimbursements to EPCO and its affiliates will reduce cash available for
Unitholders may not have limited liability if a court finds that unitholder action
constitutes control of our business.
Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions.
Our general partner s interest in us and the control of our general partner may be
transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.
Tax Risks to Common Unitholders
Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity-level
taxation by individual states. If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation or if we
were to become subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax
purposes, then our cash distributions to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.
A successful IRS contest of the federal income tax positions we take may adversely impact the market for our common units, and the costs of any contests will be borne by our unitholders and our general partner.
Even if our common unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us, they will be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income.
Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be different than
Tax-exempt entities and foreign persons face unique tax issues from owning common
units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.
We treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could result in a decrease in the value of our common units.
Our common unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do not live as a result of an investment in our common units.
The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during a twelve-month period will result
in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.
