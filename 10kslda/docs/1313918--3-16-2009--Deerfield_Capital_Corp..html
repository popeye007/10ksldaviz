                    We may be unable to maintain adequate liquidity to support our ongoing operations and planned growth.
An increase in our borrowing costs relative to the interest we receive on our assets may impair our profitability and thus our available cash.
Declines in the market values of our investments may adversely affect our financial results and credit availability, which may reduce our earnings and thus available cash.
Continued adverse developments in the mortgage sector, and the current weakness in the broader financial market, may continue to adversely affect us and one or more of our lenders, which could result in further increases in our borrowing costs, reductions in our liquidity and reductions in the value of the investments in our portfolio.
DFR and DCM are the subject of information requests by the SEC in an investigation that could result in SEC proceedings against us.
Current conditions in the credit markets have necessitated workforce reductions and led to employee resignations, which may harm our business.
We may change our investment strategy without stockholder consent, and our Board does not approve each investment decision made by management.
Rapid changes in the values of our investments may make it more difficult for us to maintain our exemption from the 1940 Act.
We may enter into warehouse agreements in connection with our planned investment in the equity securities of CDOs or DCM s planned management of CDOs, and if the CDO investments are not consummated, the warehoused collateral will be sold, and we may be required to bear any loss resulting from such sale.
Our business could be impaired if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.
Failure to procure adequate capital and funding would hurt our results and reduce the price of our stock.
We may in the future issue shares of additional capital stock to raise proceeds for a wide variety of purposes, which could dilute and therefore reduce the value of our existing outstanding capital stock.
Our stockholder rights plan could inhibit a change in our control.
Future classes of capital stock may impose, and our currently outstanding trust preferred securities do impose, significant covenants and obligations on us and our operations.
Loss of our 1940 Act exemption would adversely affect us and reduce the market price of our shares.
Our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of business, and we may enter into new businesses, make future strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business.
The NYSE Alternext may delist our securities, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
If our securities are delisted from the NYSE Alternext, our common stock may become subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC, which would make transactions in our common stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock.
Failure to develop effective business continuity plans could disrupt our operations and cause financial losses.
We could incur losses due to trading errors.
We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.
Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market for our stock, the industry in which we conduct our operations and our profitability.
Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flows, and we may also incur significantly increased costs and maintain lower coverage in the future thereby increasing our risk of loss.
We have significant indebtedness, and our leverage could adversely affect our financial health.
Risks Related to Our Investment Management Segment
DCM s revenues fluctuate based on the amount or value of client assets, which could decrease for various reasons including investment losses and withdrawal of capital.
DCM s performance fees may increase earnings volatility, which could depress our stock price.
Poor investment performance could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in DCM s revenues.
DCM derives much of its revenues from contracts that may be terminated on short notice.
DCM has experienced and may continue to experience declines in and deferrals of management fee income from its CDOs due to defaults, downgrades and depressed market values with respect to the collateral underlying such CDOs.
DCM could lose management fee income from the CDOs it manages or client AUM as a result of the triggering of certain structural protections built into such CDOs.
The loss of key portfolio managers and other personnel could harm DCM s business.
DCM may need to offer new investment strategies and products in order to continue to generate revenue.
Changes in the fixed income markets could adversely affect DCM.
Changes in CDO spreads and the current market environment could make it difficult for DCM to launch new CDOs.
DCM may be unable to increase its AUM in certain of its investment vehicles, or it may have to reduce such assets, because of capacity constraints.
DCM depends on third-party distribution channels to market its CDOs and anticipates developing third-party distribution channels to market its investment funds.
The fixed income alternative asset management industry is highly competitive, and DCM may lose client assets due to competition from other asset managers that have greater resources than DCM or that are able to offer services and products at more competitive prices.
DCM s failure to comply with investment guidelines set by its clients or the provisions of the management agreement and other agreements to which it is a party could result in damage awards against DCM and a loss of AUM, either of which could cause our earnings to decline.
DCM could lose client assets as the result of adverse publicity.
Changes in laws, regulations or government policies affecting DCM s businesses could limit its revenues, increase its costs of doing business and materially and adversely affect its business.
Risks Related to Our Principal Investing Segment
We may not realize gains or income from our investments.
We will lose money on our repurchase transactions if the counterparty to the transaction defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying security has declined as of the end of that term or if we default on our obligations under the repurchase agreement.
Changes in prepayment rates could reduce the value of our RMBS, which could reduce our earnings and overall liquidity.
We have incurred substantial impairments of our assets and may incur significant impairments in the future.
Our investment portfolio is heavily concentrated in adjustable-rate RMBS, and we might not be able to achieve or sustain a more diversified portfolio.
Mortgage loan modification programs and future legislative action may adversely affect the value of, and the returns, on the Agency RMBS in which we invest.
There can be no assurance that the actions taken by the U.S. and foreign governments, central banks and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of seeking to stabilize the financial markets will achieve the intended effect or benefit our business, and further government or market developments could adversely affect us.
Our real estate investments are subject to risks particular to real property.
The mortgage loans underlying our RMBS are subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which could result in losses to us.
Our Corporate Loan portfolio includes debt of middle market companies.
We may invest in the equity and mezzanine securities of CDOs, and such investments involve various risks, including that CDO equity receives distributions from the CDO only if the CDO generates enough income to first pay the holders of its debt securities and its expenses.
Increases in interest rates could reduce the value of our investments, which could result in losses or reduced earnings.
Some of our investments are recorded at values based on estimates of fair value made by management, and there is thus uncertainty as to the value of these investments.
The lack of liquidity in our investments may impair our results.
The current prolonged economic slowdown, recession and declining real estate values may impair our investments and harm our operating results.
Our interest rate hedging transactions may not completely insulate us from interest rate risk.
Hedging instruments often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any U.S. or foreign governmental authorities and involve risks and costs.
Our derivative contracts could expose us to unexpected economic losses.
Our dependence on the management of other entities may adversely affect our business.
Our due diligence may not reveal all of an issuer s liabilities and may not reveal other weaknesses in its business.
We are exposed to risk based on the concentration of the majority of our repurchase agreements with a single counterparty.
The conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the U.S. government, may adversely affect our business.
Changes in laws and regulations other than those affecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could adversely affect our business and ability to operate.
Our ability to use net operating loss carryovers and net capital loss carryovers to reduce future taxable income may be limited.
Preserving the ability to use our NOLs and NCLs may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.
Failure to qualify as a REIT in prior years would subject us to federal income tax.
