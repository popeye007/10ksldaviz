                    We have a history of operating losses and negative cash flows and we may not become profitable in the future, which could ultimately result in our inability to continue operations in the normal course of business.
Our stock price has reflected a great deal of volatility, including a significant decrease over the past few years. The volatility may mean that, at times, our shareholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above the price at which they acquired them.
We have effected or entered into (and will likely continue to effect or enter into) capital raising transactions, acquisitions, legal settlements and contracts for services that involve the issuance of shares of our common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares) and, as a result, the value of our common stock may be further diluted.
We have issued and outstanding a significant number of derivative securities (e.g., options and warrants) and the conversion or exercise of such securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
We rely heavily on revenues derived from sales to various governmental agencies, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from government agencies could result in significant losses and deficits in cash flows from operations.
Our Animal Applications segment relies heavily on revenue from a principal distributor and two customers and the loss of the principal distributor and customers could negatively affect our revenue, cash flows and results of operations.
Our InfoTech segment relies heavily on revenues derived from two customers, and the loss of revenue from either of these customers could result in significant losses and deficits in cash flows from operations.
Our Advance Technology segment's subsidiary, PDSC, relies heavily on revenues from one customer and the loss of revenue from this customer could result in significant losses and deficits in cash flows from operations.
Our Advance Technology segment's subsidiary, PDSC, relies heavily on revenues from one customer and the loss of revenue from this customer could result in significant losses and deficits in cash flows from operations.
Over the past few years, we have made significant changes in the nature and scope of our businesses and we have expanded into different product lines, including new, unproven technologies.
We may be subject to costly product liability claims from the use of our systems, which could damage our reputation, impair the marketability of our systems and force us to pay costs and damages that may not be covered by adequate insurance.
We are endeavoring to create a market for our VeriMed system. We may never achieve market acceptance or significant sales of this system.
We believe that sales of our implantable microchip, and the extent to which our VeriMed system achieves market acceptance, will depend, in part, on the availability of insurance reimbursement from third-party payers, including federal and state governments under programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private insurance plans. Insurers may not determine to cover the cost of the implant procedure, or it may take a considerable period of time for this to occur.
Even if our VeriMed system achieves some level of market acceptance, the anticipated significant and growing recurrent revenue from microchip-implanted persons subscribing to our database may not be realized.
If others assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, including rights to the patent covering our implantable microchip for human applications, we may be drawn into costly disputes and risk paying substantial damages or losing the right to sell our products.
We obtain the implantable microchip used in our VeriMed, VeriGuard, VeriTrace and Animal Application segment s products from a single supplier, making us vulnerable to supply disruptions that could constrain our sales of such systems and/or increase our per-unit cost of production of the microchip.
Our sales of systems that incorporate our implantable microchip for human use may be enjoined by third parties who have rights to the intellectual property used in these systems and we may be required to pay damages which would have an adverse effect on our business.
Our inability to safeguard our intellectual property may adversely affect our business by causing us to lose a competitive advantage or by forcing us to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation to defend or enforce our rights.
Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States.
We may not be successful in our efforts to obtain federal registration of our trademarks containing the Veri prefix with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
Implantation of our human implantable microchip may be found to cause risks to a person s health, which could adversely affect sales of our systems which incorporate the implantable microchip.
If we are required to effect a recall of our implantable microchip, our reputation could be materially and adversely affected and the cost of any such recall could be substantial, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Domestic and foreign government regulation and other factors could impair our ability to develop and sell our electronic animal identification products in certain markets.
Interruptions in access to, or the hacking into, our VeriMed patient information database may have a negative impact on our revenue, damage our reputation and expose us to litigation.
Regulation of products and services that collect personally-identifiable information or otherwise monitor an individual s activities may make the provision of our services more difficult or expensive and could jeopardize our growth prospects.
If we fail to comply with anti-kickback and false claims laws, we could be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation and possible fines or other penalties.
We have substantial debt and debt service.
Our consolidated revenues, assets and cash position may decline significantly if our majority-owned subsidiary, Digital Angel, is unable to comply with its payment and other obligations under its credit facility with Imperium Master Fund, Ltd.
Our consolidated revenues and cash position may decline if our majority-owned subsidiary, InfoTech, is unable to comply with its payment and other obligations under its credit facilities with Wells Fargo Business Credit, Inc. and IBM Credit LLC.
Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we write-off goodwill and other intangible assets.
The sale of shares of common stock to third parties by our subsidiaries at prices below the per share carrying amount of our investments has given (and may, in the future, give) rise to losses in our consolidated statement of operations and our inability to consolidate their operations.
We face the risk that the value of our inventory may decline before it is sold or that our inventory may not be able to be sold at the anticipated prices.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial results.
If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our stock price.
New accounting pronouncements may significantly impact our future results of operations and earnings per share.
