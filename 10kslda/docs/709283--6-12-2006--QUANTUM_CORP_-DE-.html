                    A large percentage of our sales come from a few customers, and these customers have no minimum or long-term purchase commitments. The loss of, or a significant reduction in demand from, one or more key customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
From time to time we make acquisitions, such as the contemplated acquisition of ADIC. The failure to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
If we draw on our contemplated $500 million credit facility with Key Bank, we will substantially increase our debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.
Our operating results depend on new product introductions, which may not be successful, in which case our business, financial condition, and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
Competition has increased, and may increasingly intensify, in the tape drive and tape automation markets as a result of competitors introducing products based on new technology standards, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We have taken considerable steps towards reducing our cost structure and may take further cost reduction actions. The steps we have taken and may take in the future may not reduce our cost structure to a level appropriate in relation to our future sales and therefore, these anticipated cost reductions may be insufficient to bring us back to profitability.
We derive almost all of our revenue from products incorporating tape technology. If competition from alternative storage technologies continues or increases, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be materially and adversely harmed.
Our tape media business generates a relatively high gross margin rate, which significantly impacts the total company gross margin rate. If we were to experience a significant decline in the tape media or tape royalty gross margin rate, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.
Third party infringement claims could result in substantial liability and significant costs, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
A significant portion of our manufacturing and sales operations occurs in foreign locations; we are increasingly exposed to risks associated with conducting our business internationally. Many of our facilities and those of important customers and suppliers are located near known earthquake fault zones or in geographic areas susceptible to other natural disasters, which could disrupt our business and require us to curtail or cease operations.
Our quarterly operating results could fluctuate significantly, and past quarterly operating results should not be used to predict future performance.
If we do not successfully manage the changes that we have made and may continue to make to our infrastructure and management, our business could be disrupted, and that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
If we fail to protect our intellectual property or if others use our proprietary technology without authorization, our competitive position may suffer.
Because we may order components from suppliers in advance of receipt of customer orders for our products which include these components, we could face a material inventory risk.
A portion of our manufacturing, including service repair, is outsourced to Jabil and other third party contract manufacturers. If we cannot obtain our products and parts from these third parties in a cost effective and timely manner that meets our customers expectations, this could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We do not control licensee pricing or licensee sales of tape media cartridges. To the extent that our royalty revenue is dependent on the prices of cartridges sold by our licensees, should these licensees significantly lower prices on the media products that they sell, such reduced pricing would lower our royalty revenue, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
We have incurred significant losses over the last few years. If we remain unprofitable and are unable to generate positive cash flow from operating activities, our ability to service our debt and fund our other business requirements, as well as obtain additional capital in the future, could be jeopardized, our business could suffer, and our assets could be impaired.
Decreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees, and proposed changes in accounting for equity compensation will adversely affect earnings.
Our stock price could become more volatile if certain institutional investors were to increase or decrease the number of shares they own. In addition, there are other factors and events that could affect the trading prices of our common stock.
We are exposed to general economic conditions which, if these conditions were to deteriorate, could result in significantly reduced sales levels and significant operating losses, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Our reliance on a limited number of third party suppliers could result in significantly increased costs and delays in the event these suppliers experience shortages or quality problems, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
Some of our production processes and materials are environmentally sensitive, and new environmental regulation could lead to increased costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations
Our credit agreement contains various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In prior year periods, we violated certain financial covenants under our credit agreement and received waivers or amendments for such violations. If in the future we violate financial covenants, it could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and liquidity.
We may be sued by our customers for product liability claims as a result of failures in our data storage products.
We must maintain appropriate levels of service inventories. If we have too little service inventory, we may experience increased levels of customer dissatisfaction. If we have too much service inventory, we may incur financial losses.
Because we rely heavily on distributors and other resellers to market and sell our products, if one or more distributors were to experience a significant deterioration in its financial condition or its relationship with us, this could disrupt the distribution of our products and reduce our revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
If the future outcomes related to the estimates used in recording tax liabilities to various taxing authorities result in higher tax liabilities than estimated, then we would have to record tax charges, which could be material.
Maxtor s failure to perform under the indemnification provisions of a tax sharing and indemnity agreement entered into with us providing for payments to us that relate to tax liabilities, penalties, and interest resulting from the conduct of our business prior to the Hard Disk Drive group disposition date could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Maxtor s failure to perform under the agreements in connection with contingent liabilities would harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
The disposition of the Hard Disk Drive group may be determined not to be tax-free, which would result in us or our stockholders, or both, incurring a substantial tax liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The tax opinion insurance policy issued in conjunction with the disposition of the Hard Disk Drive group does not cover all circumstances under which the disposition could become taxable to us, and as a result, we could incur an uninsured tax liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
If we incur an uninsured tax liability as a result of the disposition of the Hard Disk Drive group, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.
We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to our position in such currencies could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
