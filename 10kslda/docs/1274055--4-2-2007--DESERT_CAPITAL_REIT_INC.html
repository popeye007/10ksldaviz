                    RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS
We have a limited operating history and might not be able to operate our business or implement our operating policies and strategies successfully.
We expect to depend on borrowings to purchase some of our assets and reach our desired amount of leverage. If we fail to obtain or renew sufficient funding on favorable terms or at all, we will be limited in our ability to acquire assets, which will harm our results of operations.
Defaults on the mortgage loans we expect to fund or acquire may reduce the value of our investment portfolio and may harm our results of operations.
Substantially all of our investments are balloon mortgage loans, which have a higher risk of payment default than amortizing loans, thereby increasing the risk to our revenues.
We expect to continue to invest in sub-prime or non-investment grade loans, which have a high risk of payment default, thereby increasing the risk to our revenues.
We expect up to approximately 25% of the loans invested in by us to be subordinated loans on real estate, which are subject to higher risks.
Commercial loans generally involve a greater risk of loss than residential loans. If a borrower defaults on its payment obligations to us, our results of operations will be harmed.
We expect up to 45% of loans invested in by us will continue to be construction loans, which are subject to the risk of failure of completion or failure of the subsequent sale of the completed project.
We expect up to 50% of loans invested in by us will continue to be acquisition and development loans, which are highly speculative
A portion of our loans are secured by leased real property, which limits our rights in the event of default and substantially increases the risk of the loss of our investment.
Decreases in the value of the property underlying our mortgage loans might decrease the value of our assets.
The property securing some of our investments may be subject to prior liens and if default on these superior encumbrances occurs, we may be required to pay installments due the superior encumbrances, which would have an adverse effect on our operating cash flow.
We do not have any limitations in our charter documents on the types of first lien mortgage loans we may fund. Therefore, our investments may not be diversified among the various loan categories we are targeting, which are acquisition and development loans, construction loans, and commercial property loans. Any lack of diversity in our investments could increase the impact of defaults on our results of operations.
We may not be able to expand our operations into new geographic regions, which may cause us to incur expenses that do not result in increased revenues, which would reduce our results of operations.
The geographic concentration of the properties underlying our investments may increase our risk of loss.
We rely on information provided to us by third parties which we cannot always verify in making our investment decisions. If any of these third parties makes an error or misrepresents information to us, we may make investments in assets that do not meet our standard investment criteria.
Interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value of our assets.
We might experience reduced net interest income or a loss from holding fixed rate investments during periods of rising interest rates.
We may incur increased borrowing costs related to credit agreements that would harm our results of operations.
Failure to obtain or maintain adequate funding under credit agreements may harm our results of operations.
Our leverage strategy increases the risks of our operations, which could reduce our net income and the amount available for distributions or cause us to suffer a loss.
The liquidation of our assets may be delayed, which may delay the distribution of liquidation proceeds to our stockholders.
An increase in interest rates might cause the value of our assets to decline.
Possible market developments could cause our lenders to require us to pledge additional assets as collateral. If our assets are insufficient to meet the collateral requirements, we might be compelled to liquidate particular assets at inopportune times and at disadvantageous prices, which may cause us to experience losses.
Because the assets underlying the loans that we expect to acquire might experience periods of illiquidity, we might be prevented from liquidating our collateral at opportune times and prices, and our capital available to acquire new investments will be reduced.
Our board of directors may change our operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval and such changes could harm our business and results of operations and the value of our stock.
Competition might prevent us from acquiring mortgages at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs which would harm our results of operations.
Insurance will not cover all potential losses on the underlying real properties and the absence thereof may impair our security and harm the value of our assets.
We depend on our key personnel, especially Todd Parriott, and the loss of any of our key personnel could severely and detrimentally affect our operations.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR ADVISOR
Our results may suffer as a consequence of a conflict of interest arising out of our relationship with our Advisor. We pay our Advisor a base management fee based on the amount of invested assets and incentive compensation based on our portfolio's performance. This arrangement may lead our Advisor to recommend riskier or more speculative investments regardless of their long-term performance in an effort to maximize its compensation.
Our Advisor has significant influence over our affairs, and might cause us to engage in transactions that are not in our or our stockholders' best interests.
Our success will depend on the performance of our Advisor and if our Advisor or our board of directors makes inadvisable investment or management decisions, our operations could be impaired, potentially causing us to suffer a loss.
We may be obligated to pay our Advisor incentive compensation even if we incur a loss.
Investors may not be able to estimate with certainty the aggregate fees and expense reimbursements that will be paid to our Advisor under the advisory agreement due to the time and manner in which our Advisor's incentive compensation and expense reimbursements are determined.
Our Advisor may render services to other entities, which could reduce the amount of time and effort that our Advisor devotes to us.
Our Advisor's liability is limited under the advisory agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify it against certain liabilities.
If our Advisor terminates the advisory agreement, we may not be able to find an adequate replacement Advisor.
RISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND TAX REQUIREMENTS
If we fail to qualify or are disqualified as a REIT, we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and face substantial tax liability.
Our management team has limited experience managing a REIT.
Complying with REIT requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.
Complying with REIT requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments.
Our investment in taxable REIT subsidiaries may exceed statutory limit.
Complying with REIT requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to our stockholders.
Failure to maintain an exemption from the Investment Company Act would harm our results of operations.
Misplaced reliance on legal opinions or statements by borrowers could result in a failure to comply with REIT income or assets tests.
One-action rules may harm the value of the underlying property.
We may be harmed by changes in various laws and regulations.
We may incur excess inclusion income that would increase the tax liability of our stockholders.
