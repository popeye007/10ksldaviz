                    Risks Related to Our Company
We are operating in an adverse business environment and have experienced higher than expected losses in our operating segments resulting from our exposure to the RMBS market and CDOs, including ABS CDOs and CDO squared, that have had, and are expected to continue to have, material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Downgrades to our IFS ratings have had, and any potential future or further downgrades of our IFS or financial enhancements ratings will continue to have, material adverse effects on our business and, consequently, our results of operations and financial condition.
We have suspended writing substantially all new business pending the implementation of our strategic plan.
Adverse developments in the credit and mortgage markets in the second half of 2007 that rapidly accelerated in the fourth quarter and the negative impact those adverse developments have had, and may continue to have, on our insured portfolio has resulted in material adverse effects to our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our capital position has been determined by the rating agencies to be insufficient to maintain our historic triple-A ratings. We require additional capital, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. If we are unable to obtain such capital and regain our historic ratings we may not be able to operate our business in its historic form.
Our liquidity and capital resources may be adversely impacted by any material unforeseen adverse developments in our case base reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses.
We are highly regulated and a regulator could rehabilitate or liquidate us, suspend our license, restrict our license authority, limit our dividend paying ability, limit the premiums we can write or take certain other actions.
Ratings downgrades have triggered and further downgrades may trigger additional provisions in our business arrangements and agreements to which we are party or subject in a manner adverse to our business.
Our reliance on available borrowings under our letter of credit and revolving credit facility to support XLFA s reinsurance operations and our liquidity subjects us to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control.
If XLCA should become insolvent or subject to a regulatory proceeding, the holders of certain of the CDS contracts XLCA has insured would have the right to terminate the contracts and require XLCA to pay them the termination values, which under current market conditions would be in excess of XLCA s resources.
A downgrade of the IFS or financial enhancement ratings of any of our reinsurers or a change in the treatment by the rating agencies of the reinsurance provided to us by subsidiaries of XL Capital adversely affects the value of the reinsurance that any such reinsurer provides to us and, therefore, could adversely affect our capital requirements.
If the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements default on their obligations to us, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Increased rating agency capital charges and downgrades to securities and transactions we insure may adversely affect us.
Loss reserve estimates are subject to uncertainties, our loss reserves may not be adequate to cover the ultimate amount of losses and if actual losses exceed our loss reserves, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Portfolio modeling contains uncertainty over ultimate outcomes which makes it difficult to estimate our potential paid claims and loss reserves.
Our insurance and reinsurance portfolio and financial guarantee products expose us to concentrations of risks, and a material adverse event or series of events with respect to one or more of these risks could result in significant losses to our business.
The size of our capital base may adversely affect our ability to grow our business and execute our business strategy.
Some of our direct financial guarantee products are different than traditional financial guarantee insurance, principally because these less traditional products, including CDS contracts, may require us to make payments of the full guaranteed amount earlier than, or upon the occurrence of events not covered by, traditional products. In certain of these events, we may be required to pay amounts in excess of our current resources.
Rules relating to certain accounting practices in the financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance industry are currently being reviewed by applicable regulatory bodies and any changes required by that review could have a material adverse effect on the reported operating results and financial condition of the industry or particular market participants, including us.
Our net income (loss) may be volatile because a significant portion of the credit risk we assume must be accounted for as credit derivatives under SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 149, which requires that these instruments be marked to market quarterly.
We face significant competition in our business and our revenues and profitability could decline as a result.
Demand for financial guarantee insurance will decline if investors confidence in financial guarantor financial strength ratings declines.
We face risks associated with a potential negative perception by investors and counterparties of our financial condition. We also face risks based on our stock price and potential suspension or removal from listing on the NYSE.
A substantial majority of our third-party reinsurance business consists of reinsuring risks from FSA and our ability to expand our third-party reinsurance business may be constrained by rating agency restrictions.
General economic factors, including fluctuations in interest rates, as well as terrorist acts or natural or other catastrophes, may adversely affect our loss experience or the demand for our products.
We face significant litigation risks.
Because our financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance policies are unconditional and irrevocable, we may incur losses from fraudulent conduct relating to the securities that we insure or reinsure.
Legislative and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our business.
Servicer risk could adversely impact performance of our structured finance transactions.
Risks Related to Our Historical Ownership by XL Capital As Well As Our Continuing Relationships with XL Capital
Our historical consolidated financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone, public company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.
The terms of the services, leasing, reinsurance, and other arrangements we obtained from or had with XL Capital may have been more or less favorable to us than we are able to obtain in the future from an unaffiliated third-party.
XL Capital owns approximately 46% of our outstanding common shares and will retain the ability to exert significant influence over us.
If XL Capital engages in the same type of business we conduct, our ability to successfully operate and expand our business may be hampered.
Conflicts may arise between us and XL Capital that could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us or investors in our securities.
U.S. taxation of XLFA could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our U.S. subsidiary may be subject to additional taxes.
Our U.K. subsidiary may be subject to additional taxes.
There is U.S. income tax risk associated with reinsurance between U.S. insurance companies and their Bermuda affiliates.
There are U.S. income tax risks associated with the controlled foreign corporation rules under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
There are U.S. income tax risks associated with the related person insurance income of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries.
U.S. holders who hold our common shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered to be a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
U.S. tax-exempt entities may recognize unrelated business taxable income.
Changes in U.S. tax law might adversely affect an investment in our shares.
Bermuda and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are considering measures that might change the manner in which we are taxed.
We may not obtain tax benefits from our tax losses.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Shares
Our subsidiaries ratings are not evaluations directed to the protection of investors in our common shares.
Future sales of our common shares may adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
There are provisions in our bye-laws that, subject to certain exceptions, reduce the voting rights of common shares that are held by a person or group to the extent that such person or group holds more than 9.5% of the aggregate voting power of all common shares entitled to vote on a matter.
There are provisions in our bye-laws which may limit a shareholder s voting rights if our Board of Directors determines to do so to avoid certain material adverse legal, tax or regulatory consequences.
There are provisions in our bye-laws that may restrict shareholders ability to transfer common shares and, therefore, may affect the liquidity of common shares.
Bermuda Law and our bye-laws provide broad indemnity and exculpation protections for the benefit of our officers, directors and employees.
Provisions in our bye-laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors or change the direction or policies of our company, which could diminish the value of our common shares.
Shareholders of our company may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation.
We are a Bermuda company and it may be difficult for our shareholders to enforce judgments against us or against our directors and executive officers.
