                    Risks Related to Our Business
We have a limited operating history and have incurred a cumulative loss since inception. If we do not generate significant revenues, we will not be profitable.
We will need substantial additional capital to fund our operations, including drug candidate development, manufacturing and commercialization. If we do not have or cannot raise additional capital when needed, we will be unable to develop and commercialize our drug candidates successfully, and our ability to operate as a going concern may be adversely affected.
We depend on the success of our HCV drug candidates, ACH-1095 and ACH-1625, which are still under development.
If we are not successful in forming an alliance for the commercialization of elvucitabine, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business may be harmed.
If we are not able to determine the most appropriate therapeutic use for ACH-702, or determine and execute a successful business strategy pursuant to that use, our business may be harmed.
Our market is subject to intense competition. If we are unable to compete effectively, our drug candidates may be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete.
If we are not able to attract and retain key management, scientific personnel and advisors, we may not successfully develop our drug candidates or achieve our other business objectives.
Our business has a substantial risk of product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain appropriate levels of insurance, a product liability claim could adversely affect our business.
We may grow through additional acquisitions, which could dilute our existing shareholders and could involve substantial integration risks.
Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties
We may not be able to execute our business strategy if we are unable to enter into alliances with other companies that can provide capabilities and funds for the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. If we are unsuccessful in forming or maintaining these alliances on favorable terms, our business may not succeed.
If a collaborative partner terminates or fails to perform its obligations under agreements with us, the development and commercialization of our drug candidates could be delayed or terminated.
We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such trials.
We currently depend on third-party manufacturers to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and intend to rely upon third-party manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of any approved drug candidates. If in the future we manufacture any of our drug candidates, we will be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to establish and maintain these capabilities.
Risks Related to the Development of Our Drug Candidates
All of our drug candidates are still in the early stages of development and remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval. If we are unable to successfully develop and test our drug candidates, we will not be successful.
If we are unable to obtain U.S. and/or foreign regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates.
If clinical trials for our drug candidates are prolonged or delayed, we may be unable to commercialize our drug candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any product revenue.
Even if we obtain regulatory approvals, our drug candidates will be subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and applicable foreign regulations, we could lose those approvals, and our business would be seriously harmed.
If we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Drug Candidates
If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our drug candidates, we may not generate product revenue.
If physicians and patients do not accept our future drugs, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.
If third-party payors do not adequately reimburse patients for any of our drug candidates that are approved for marketing, they might not be purchased or used, and our revenues and profits will not develop or increase.
Federal legislation has increased the pressure to reduce prices of pharmaceutical products paid for by Medicare, which could adversely affect our revenues, if any.
Risks Related to Patents and Licenses
If we are unable to adequately protect our drug candidates, or if we infringe the rights of others, our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates will be harmed.
We license patent rights from third-party owners. If such owners do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
Litigation regarding patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights may be expensive and time consuming. If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing drug candidates to market and harm our ability to operate.
Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property.
Risks Relating to Our Common Stock
We may be required to dilute our existing stockholders further in connection with capital raising activities and certain purchasers may beneficially own significant blocks of our common stock. Additionally, the market price of our common stock may fall due to the increased number of shares available in the public market.
Our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders own a large percentage of our voting common stock and could limit our stockholders influence on corporate decisions or could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.
Our stock price is likely to be volatile, and the market price of our common stock may decline in value in the future.
Unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business.
Our management is required to devote substantial time and incur additional expense to comply with public company regulations. Our failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to public investigations, fines, enforcement actions and other sanctions by regulatory agencies and authorities and, as a result, our stock price could decline in value.
We do not anticipate paying cash dividends, and accordingly stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us.
