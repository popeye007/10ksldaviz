                    Risks Relating to Development of KRYSTEXXA and Our Ability to Accomplish Our Future Business Objectives
Our business depends on our success in gaining FDA approval of KRYSTEXXA, which requires that we and our third-party manufacturer, BTG, address several issues raised by the FDA. If these issues are not satisfactorily addressed, we will not gain FDA approval of KRYSTEXXA and our business will be materially harmed.
Even if the FDA grants marketing approval for KRYSTEXXA, the FDA may decide to approve the labeling for indications that are not as broad as we requested. In addition, if the FDA approves our BLA, the final label may prescribe safety limits or warnings, and we will be required to implement a REMS program to minimize the potential risks of the treatment of KRYSTEXXA. Such additional obligations and commitments may increase the cost of commercializing KRYSTEXXA, limit the commercial success of KRYSTEXXA and result in lower than expected future earnings.
Unless we are successful in consummating a worldwide partnership for the commercialization of KRYSTEXXA or a broader strategic transaction involving our company, we may need to raise substantial additional capital to complete the development of and execute upon our commercial strategy for KRYSTEXXA. Such financing may only be available on terms unacceptable to us, or not at all. If we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
Our business focuses primarily on the development of a single product, KRYSTEXXA. If we are unable to complete the development of and execute upon our commercial strategy for KRYSTEXXA, or if we experience significant delays or unanticipated costs in doing so, our ability to generate product revenue and our likelihood of success will be materially harmed.
We have limited marketing and no sales capabilities. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities or enter into sales and marketing agreements with third parties, we may be unable to generate product sales revenue from sales to customers.
The commercial success of KRYSTEXXA will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, health care payors and others in the medical community. If KRYSTEXXA does
not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate sufficient additional revenues to achieve or maintain profitability.
Our business may be harmed if we do not adequately predict the market size or customer demand for KRYSTEXXA.
We face substantial competition, and our competitors may develop or commercialize alternative technologies or products more successfully than we do.
If we fail to attract and retain senior management and other key personnel, we may not be able to complete the development of or execute upon our commercial strategy for KRYSTEXXA.
If it is approved for sale, KRYSTEXXA could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties, if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with the product, which would materially harm our business.
If we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, or acceptable prices, for KRYSTEXXA, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.
Failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products abroad and could materially adversely affect our business.
Foreign governments tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues.
Risks Relating to Our Reliance on Third Parties
We have no manufacturing capabilities and limited manufacturing personnel. We depend on third parties to manufacture KRYSTEXXA. If these manufacturers fail to meet our manufacturing requirements at acceptable quality levels and at acceptable cost, and if we are unable to identify suitable replacements, our commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.
The manufacture and packaging of pharmaceutical products such as KRYSTEXXA are subject to the requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to satisfy these requirements, our product development and commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.
Qualifying Diosynth as a global secondary source supplier of pegloticase API, any other change to any of our third-party manufacturers for KRYSTEXXA or any change in the location where KRYSTEXXA is manufactured would require prior FDA review, approval and validation of the manufacturing process and procedures for KRYSTEXXA. This review, approval and validation would be costly and time consuming and could delay or prevent the manufacture of KRYSTEXXA at such facility.
If the company from which we source our mPEG-NPC is unable to supply us with product, our business may suffer.
If the company on which we plan to rely for fill and finish services for KRYSTEXXA is unable to perform these services for us, our business may suffer.
We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical development activities for KRYSTEXXA and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, which could delay regulatory approval and commercialization of KRYSTEXXA.
We are seeking a worldwide partner for the further development and commercialization of KRYSTEXXA, and we expect to continue to depend on collaborations with third parties. If we are not successful in these efforts, we may fail to meet our business objectives.
Risks Relating to Intellectual Property
If we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.
If we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property relating to our technology and products, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.
If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.
If we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, our business may be adversely affected.
In the future we may be involved in costly legal proceedings to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others.
Risks Relating to Our Results of Operations and Your Investment in Our Common Stock
We may not be able to achieve profitability. We have incurred operating losses from continuing operations since 2004 and anticipate that we will incur operating losses from continuing operations for the foreseeable future, particularly as a result of increasing expenses related to our development and, if our BLA is approved by the FDA, commercialization of KRYSTEXXA.
We expect sales of Oxandrin and oxandrolone to remain flat or continue to decrease, which may continue to harm our results of operations.
Our stock price is volatile, which could adversely affect your investment.
We expect our quarterly results to fluctuate, which may cause volatility in our stock price.
We are a party to a stockholder lawsuit regarding the adequacy of our public disclosure, which could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our outstanding warrants may be exercised in the future, which would increase the number of shares of our common stock in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.
Effecting a change of control of our company could be difficult, which may discourage offers for shares of our common stock.
Product liability lawsuits could cause us to incur substantial liabilities.
