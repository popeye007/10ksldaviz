                    Risks Related to Our Business
We are a development stage company with no operating history and, accordingly, you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
If we are forced to dissolve and liquidate before a business combination and distribute the trust account, our public stockholders may receive less than $8.00 per share and our warrants will expire worthless.
If we do not consummate a business combination and are forced to dissolve, payments from the trust account to our public stockholders may be delayed.
Upon distribution of the trust account, our stockholders may be held liable for claims of third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.
If the net proceeds from the initial public offering that were not placed in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate until October, 2008, we may not be able to complete a business combination.
You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies.
If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share liquidation price received by stockholders will be less than the approximately $7.88 per share held in trust.
Under Delaware law, the requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering contained in our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended, which could reduce or eliminate the protection afforded to our stockholders by such requirements and restrictions.
Since we have not yet selected any target acquisition with which to complete a business combination, we are unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the business operations.
There may be tax consequences associated with our acquisition, holding and disposition of target companies and assets.
We may issue shares of our capital stock to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.
We may issue debt securities, which could limit our ability to operate our business and return value to our stockholders.
Our ability to successfully consummate a business combination and to be successful thereafter will be dependent upon the efforts of our management.
Our officers and directors will allocate some portion of their time to other businesses, thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination.
Our officers and directors currently are, and may in the future become affiliated with additional entities that are, engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
If we seek to effect a business combination with an entity that is directly or indirectly affiliated with one or more of our officers and directors, conflicts of interest could arise.
Our current officers and directors may resign upon consummation of a business combination.
The 2,812,500 shares of common stock owned by our officers and directors will not participate in liquidation distributions, and a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular target acquisition is appropriate for a business combination.
There is no guarantee that a market for our securities will be maintained, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.
If our common stock becomes subject to the SEC s penny stock rules, broker-dealers may experience difficulty in completing customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.
Initially, we may only be able to complete one business combination, which may cause us to be solely dependent on a single business and a limited number of products or services.
The ability of our stockholders to exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.
Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, we may not be able to consummate a business combination during the prescribed time period.
We may have insufficient resources to cover our operating expenses and the expenses of consummating a business combination.
Our existing stockholders, including all of our officers and directors, control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.
Our outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to effect a business combination.
The exercise by our existing stockholders of their registration rights may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and the existence of the registration rights may make it more difficult to effect a business combination.
If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination, or we may be required to incur additional expenses if we are unable to dissolve after the expiration of the allotted time periods.
We may or may not obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party as to the fair market value of the target acquisition or that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our stockholders.
The American Stock Exchange may require us to submit a new listing application, subject to the initial listing requirements, in connection with a business combination, or may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to effect transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
If we are unable to maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock underlying our warrants, our warrants may have no value and the market for our warrants may be limited.
We may choose to redeem our outstanding warrants at a time that is disadvantageous to our warrant holders.
Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.
Risks Related to Doing Business Outside the United States
Since we may acquire a target business that is located outside the United States, we may encounter risks specific to one or more countries in which we ultimately operate.
Foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements prepared in accordance with and reconciled to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we will not be able to complete a business combination with some prospective target businesses unless their financial statements are first reconciled to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Risks Associated with the Telecommunications and Media Industries
We may be subject to significant regulatory requirements in connection with our efforts to consummate a business combination with a company in the telecommunications and media industries, which may result in our failure to consummate our initial business combination within the required time frame and may force us to liquidate.
Our investments in telecommunications and media companies may be extremely risky due, in part, to market conditions, and we could lose all or part of our investments.
The information available regarding telecommunications and media companies is limited which could result in poor investment decisions on our part and we could lose all or part of our investments.
If we make an investment in a telecommunications and media company that is dependent on current management, the loss of such management may materially affect results of operations.
The telecommunications and media industries are highly cyclical, which may materially affect our future performance and ability to sell our products or services and, in turn, hurt our profitability.
If we are unable to keep pace with the changes in the telecommunications and media industries, the products of any target business that we acquire could become obsolete and it could materially hurt our results of operations.
The telecommunications and media industries are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively which could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability upon consummation of a business combination.
We may not be able to comply with government regulations that may be adopted with respect to the telecommunications and media industries.
We may be unable to protect or enforce the intellectual property rights of any target businesses that we acquire.
Government regulation of the telecommunications and media industries and the uncertainty over government regulation of the Internet could harm our operating results and future prospects.
