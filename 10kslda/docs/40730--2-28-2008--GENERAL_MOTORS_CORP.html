Risks related to our 49% ownership interest in GMAC
General business, economic and market conditions as well as continuing weakness in the residential mortgage market may significantly affect the operating results of GMAC s business and earnings and may require us to record an impairment of our equity investment in GMAC.
If GMAC s equity capital decreases, it may not be able to pay dividends or may pay partial dividends on the Preferred Membership Interests that we hold.
GMAC s automotive finance business is critical to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales; if GMAC is unable to provide financial support in its current form our business will be materially adversely affected.
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Rating agencies have recently downgraded their ratings for GMAC and ResCap, and there could be further downgrades in the future. Future downgrades would further adversely affect GMAC s ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates and increase the interest that GMAC pays on new borrowings, which could have a material adverse effect on GMAC s results of operations and financial condition.
GMAC s business requires substantial capital, and if GMAC is unable to maintain adequate financing sources, GMAC s profitability and financial condition will suffer and jeopardize GMAC s ability to continue operations.

If GMAC s estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, its cash flow, profitability, financial condition and business prospects could be materially adversely affected.
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
GMAC s business outside the United States exposes it to additional risks that may cause GMAC s revenues and profitability to decline.
GMAC s business could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates.

Fluctuations in valuation of investment securities or significant fluctuations in investment market prices could negatively affect revenues.
Changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage programs, or disruptions in the secondary markets in the United States or in other countries in which GMAC s mortgage subsidiaries operate, could adversely affect the profitability and financial condition of GMAC s mortgage business.
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
GMAC may be required to repurchase contracts and provide indemnification if it breaches representations and warranties from its securitization and whole-loan transactions, which could harm GMAC s profitability and financial condition.
