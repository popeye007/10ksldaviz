                    Risks Related to Our Business
Our operating results are subject to fluctuations, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may decrease significantly.
If we fail to develop and introduce new products and services successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner, we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.
Our smartphone and handheld products may contain errors or defects, which could result in the rejection or return of our products, damage to our reputation, lost revenues, diverted development resources and increased service costs, warranty claims and litigation.
We are highly dependent on wireless carriers for the success of our smartphone products.
As we build strategic relationships with wireless carriers, we could be exposed to significant fluctuations in revenue for our smartphone products.
We are dependent on a concentrated number of significant customers and the loss or credit failure of any of those customers could have an adverse affect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.
If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, we could experience price reductions, reduced demand for our products and services, reduced margins and loss of market share, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.
If we do not correctly forecast demand for our products, we could have costly excess production or inventories or we may not be able to secure sufficient or cost effective quantities of our products or production materials and our revenues, cost of revenues and financial condition could be adversely impacted.
We rely on third parties to sell and distribute our products, and we rely on their information to manage our business. Disruption of our relationship with these channel partners, changes in their business practices, their failure to provide timely and accurate information or conflicts among our channels of distribution could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If our smartphone products do not meet wireless carrier and governmental or regulatory certification requirements, we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.
We rely on third parties to design, manufacture, distribute, warehouse and support our smartphone and handheld products, and our reputation, revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if these third parties fail to meet their performance obligations.
We depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source and some of which are our competitors, for certain components, software applications and elements of our technology, and our production or reputation could be harmed if these suppliers were unable or unwilling to meet our demand or technical requirements on a timely and/or a cost-effective basis.
Our product strategy is substantially dependent on the Palm OS, which is owned by PalmSource, a former subsidiary of Palm that was acquired by Access Co., Ltd.
If we are unable to obtain key technologies from third parties on a timely basis and free from errors or defects, we may have to delay or cancel the release of certain products or features in our products or incur increased costs.
Our product strategy is substantially dependent on our ability to differentiate the operating systems that we include in our mobile computing devices.
The market for smartphone and handheld products is volatile, and changing market conditions, or failure to adjust to changing market conditions, may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition, particularly given our size, limited resources and lack of diversification.
We rely on third parties to manage and operate our e-commerce web store and related telesales call center, and disruption to this sales channel could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
Third parties have claimed, and may claim in the future, that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products regardless of whether these claims are successful.
We are subject to general commercial litigation and other litigation claims as part of our operations, and we could suffer significant litigation expenses in defending these claims and could be subject to significant damage awards or other remedies.
Our products are subject to increasingly stringent laws, standards and other regulatory requirements, and the costs of compliance or failure to comply may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Allegations of health risks associated with electromagnetic fields and wireless communications devices, and the lawsuits and publicity relating to them, regardless of merit, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our success largely depends on our ability to hire, retain, integrate and motivate sufficient numbers of qualified personnel, including senior management. Our strategy and our ability to innovate, design and produce new products, sell products, maintain operating margins and control expenses depend on key personnel that may be difficult to replace.
If third parties infringe our intellectual property or if we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property, we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury.
We have an international presence in countries whose laws may not provide protection of our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which may make it more difficult for us to protect our intellectual property.
We may pursue strategic acquisitions and investments which could have an adverse impact on our business if they are unsuccessful.
Our ability to utilize our net operating losses may be limited if we engage in transactions which bring cumulative change in ownership for Palm to 50% or more.
Changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause unexpected fluctuations in and adversely affect our reported results of operations.
We may need or find it advisable to seek additional funding which may not be available or which may result in substantial dilution of the value of our common stock.
Our future results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international sales and operations.
We use third parties to provide significant operational and administrative services, and our ability to satisfy our customers and operate our business will suffer if the level of services is interrupted or does not meet our requirements.
Business interruptions could adversely affect our business.
Wars, terrorist attacks or other threats beyond our control could negatively impact consumer confidence, which could harm our operating results.
We own land that is not currently being utilized in our business. If our expected ability to ultimately recover the carrying value of this land is impaired, we would incur a non-cash charge against our results of operations.
Our historical financial information may not be reliable as an indicator of future results due to the spin-off of PalmSource and the acquisition of Handspring. In addition, charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect our results of operations.
PalmSource may be required to indemnify us for tax liabilities we may incur in connection with the distribution of PalmSource common stock to our stockholders, and we may be required to indemnify PalmSource for specified taxes.
Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock
Our common stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility.
Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent acquisition of us, which could decrease the value of shares of our common stock.
