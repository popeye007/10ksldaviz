                    RISKS RELATED TO OUR PROPERTIES AND OUR BUSINESS
We may incur substantial debt. Borrowing creates risks that the offering proceeds may be insufficient to pay or our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations.
Interest only indebtedness may increase our risk of default and ultimately may reduce our funds available for distribution to our stockholders.
Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
Lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
Adverse economic conditions and competition may impede our ability to renew leases or re-lease units as leases expire and require us to undertake unbudgeted capital improvements, which could harm our business and operating results.
Our debt covenants may restrict our operating activities, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.
Our working capital reserves may not be adequate to cover all of our cash needs, in which case we will have to obtain financing from other sources.
Our advisor may not be successful in identifying suitable additional acquisitions that meet our criteria.
We face competition for the acquisition of apartment communities, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of acquisitions.
We may have to make expedited decisions on whether to invest in certain properties, including prior to receipt of detailed information on the property.
Rising operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and funds available for future distributions.
Renovation of properties may result in increased costs and loss of income during the renovation period.
Development and construction of properties may result in delays and increased costs and risks.
Discovery of previously undetected environmentally hazardous conditions and physical defects may adversely affect our operating results.
We may face conflicts with sellers, partners and joint venturers.
The liquidation of our assets may be delayed.
We expect to make distributions that include a return of capital.
Uninsured losses or high premiums for insurance coverage relating to our Jacksonville apartment communities could adversely affect our operating results, our cash flow and our ability to authorize distributions to our stockholders.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE
The board of directors can take many actions without stockholder approval.
Our organizational documents contain provisions which may discourage a takeover of our company and depress our stock price.
(1) There are ownership limits and restrictions on transferability in our articles of incorporation.
(2) Our articles permit our board of directors to issue preferred stock with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us.
(3) Our articles and bylaws contain other possible anti-takeover provisions.
(4) Maryland law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.
Our business will be harmed if we cannot engage and retain the services of reputable and reliable managers for our properties.
Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.
Mortgage debt obligations expose us to increased risk of loss of property, which could harm our financial condition.
Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition.
If we suffer losses that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of our insurance coverage limits, we could lose invested capital and anticipated profits.
Your interest in our company may be diluted if we issue additional shares and your distributions may be affected.
RISKS RELATED TO THE PUBLIC OFFERING
We are dependent on our advisor and the property managers.
We have a limited operating history.
Payment of fees to our advisor and its affiliates were not determined in arm s length negotiations and will reduce cash available for investment and distribution.
Debt service payments and restrictive covenants in credit agreements may prevent or delay our ability to invest in new communities.
We may not have available operating cash flows from any of the communities described in this annual report to pay distributions to stockholders.
We are dependent on the dealer-manager.
Stockholders may not be able to liquidate their investment promptly at a reasonable price.
You cannot evaluate all of the properties we may own.
Limited diversification increases risk of loss.
Our management and that of our advisor have little experience investing in market rate apartment communities and no experience operating a REIT.
You are limited in your ability to sell shares pursuant to our share redemption program.
An independent underwriter will not make an independent investigation of our company or the offering prospectus which are customarily performed in underwritten offerings.
There has been no public market for our common stock.
Your investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
Our capital raising ability is principally reliant on one selected dealer.
Your subscription payment is irrevocable.
We will be subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationships with our advisor and its affiliates, including the material conflicts discussed below.
There are certain relationships between our company and other entities providing services to us.
The directors may determine in the future that it may be in the best interest of our company to become completely or partially self-administered.
We will experience competition for properties.
There will be competing demands on our officers and directors.
The timing of acquisitions and sales may favor our advisor.
We may invest with affiliates of our advisor.
There is no separate counsel for our company, our affiliates and stockholders.
We currently intend to convert to an UPREIT structure.
TAX AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN RISKS
If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, our distributions will not be deductible by us, and our income will be subject to taxation, reducing our earnings available for distribution.
Because we acquired properties prior to qualification as a REIT, we may face certain tax consequences.
To qualify as a REIT, we cannot have at the end of any taxable year any undistributed earnings and profits that are attributable to a non-REIT taxable year.
Even REITs are subject to federal and state income taxes.
If more than fifty percent in value of our outstanding shares is owned directly, indirectly or through attribution by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year, we will not qualify as a REIT and will not be able to make a new REIT election until the fifth taxable year after we lose our REIT status.
An investment in our common stock may not be suitable for every employee benefit plan.
Following the consummation of the UPREIT restructuring, if our operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership, its income may be subject to tax, which would reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
