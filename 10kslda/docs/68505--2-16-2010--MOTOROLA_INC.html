                    We wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence.
Our strategy to separate our businesses into two publicly-traded companies may have a negative impact on our business operations, operating results and assets.
The uncertainty of current economic and political conditions makes budgeting and forecasting very difficult and may reduce demand for our products.
We face a number of risks related to the financial crisis and severe tightening in the global credit markets that began in late 2008 and continued throughout 2009.
We face a number of risks because the Company's long-term debt rating is rated non-investment grade by one credit rating agency resulting in the Company being a "split rated credit" and because our short-term debt is rated of F-3/P-3:
The Company's ability to borrow funds under its credit agreement could be constrained by the level of eligible domestic receivables and inventory.
We operate in highly competitive markets and our financial results will be affected if we are not able to compete effectively.
Our success depends in part on our timely introduction of new products and technologies and our results can be impacted by the effectiveness of our significant investments in new products and technologies.
We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Our ability to complete these actions and the impact of such actions on our business may be limited by a variety of factors. The cost-reduction actions, in turn, may expose us to additional production risk and have a negative impact on our sales, profitability and ability to attract and retain employees.
The demand for our products depends, in part, on the continued growth of the industries in which we participate. A market decline in any one of these industries could have a negative impact on our business.
Our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and, as a result, we face risks that other companies that are not global may not face.
Changes in our operations or sales outside the U.S. markets could result in lost benefits in impacted countries and increase our cost of doing business.
We may not generate sufficient future taxable income, which may require additional deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
If the quality of our products does not meet our customers' expectations, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.
If the volume of our sales decrease or do not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs that may make our products less competitive.
Industry convergence between telecom, data and media presents opportunities for our business, but also presents risks.
Our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts and components to meet the demands of our customers.
The outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the IRS could impact our financial results.
Many of our components and products are designed or manufactured by third parties and if third-party manufacturers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third-party manufacturers, it may have a negative impact on our business.
We may be required to record additional goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in an additional significant charge to earnings.
Failure of our suppliers to use acceptable ethical business practices could negatively impact our business.
Our success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to form successful strategic alliances. If these arrangements do not develop as expected, our business may be negatively impacted.
We rely on third-party distributors, representatives and retailers to sell certain of our products.
We face many risks relating to intellectual property rights.
Our future financial results may be negatively impacted if we are not successful in licensing our intellectual property.
Copyright levies in numerous countries for the sale of products may negatively impact our business.
We may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from the acquisitions.
The value of our investments in the securities of various companies fluctuates and it may be difficult for us to realize the value of these investments.
It may be difficult for us to recruit and retain the types of engineers and other highly-skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive.
Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, retain and prepare succession plans for senior management and key employees.
The unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation or administrative action could negatively impact the Company.
We are exposed to risks under large multi-year system contracts that may negatively impact our business.
It is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance we are forced to retain the risk.
We are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety and environmental laws.
Government regulation of radio frequencies may limit the growth of the wireless communications industry or reduce barriers to entry for new competitors.
Changes in government policies and laws or economic conditions may negatively impact our financial results.
We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our operations, sales and operating results.
Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile.
We have had substantial operating losses in each of the last three years and may continue to incur losses as we continue to reposition our Mobile Devices business.
The worldwide wireless mobile handset market contracted in 2009 compared to 2008 and further declines in this worldwide market could negatively impact transition plans for our Mobile Devices business.
Our strategy for the Mobile Devices business may be too concentrated on certain products.
We have lost significant market share in our Mobile Devices businesses and such loss has negatively impacted our performance and may continue to negatively impact our financial results.
Our future financial results may be negatively impacted if we do not execute on our hardware and software strategy for our Mobile Devices business.
If our operating system strategy is not successful, our Mobile Devices business could be negatively impacted.
Consolidations in both the cable and telecommunication industries may negatively impact our business.
The effects of FCC regulations requiring separation of security functionality from set-tops could negatively impact our sales of set-tops to cable providers.
