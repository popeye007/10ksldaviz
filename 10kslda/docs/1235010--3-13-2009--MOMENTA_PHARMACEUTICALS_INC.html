                    Risks Relating to our Business
We have a limited operating history and have incurred a cumulative loss since inception. If we do not generate significant revenues, we will not be profitable.
If we fail to obtain approval for and commercialize our most advanced product candidate, M-Enoxaparin, we may have to curtail our product development programs and our business would be materially harmed.
If other generic versions of Lovenox are approved and successfully commercialized, our business would suffer.
Our patent litigation with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the innovator of Copaxone, may cause delays and additional expense in the commercialization of M356. If we are not successful in commercializing M356 or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.
If other generic versions of our product candidates are approved and successfully commercialized, our business would suffer.
We utilize new technologies in the development of some of our products that have not been reviewed or accepted by regulatory authorities.
If the raw materials, including unfractionated heparin, or UFH, used in our products become difficult to obtain, significantly increase in cost or become unavailable, we may be unable to produce our products and this would have a material adverse impact on our business.
If we or our collaborative partners and other third parties are unable to satisfy FDA quality standards, experience manufacturing difficulties or are unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates, including M-Enoxaparin and M118, our development and commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.
We will require substantial additional funds to execute our business plan and, if additional capital is not available, we may need to limit, scale back or cease our operations.
Patent litigation with Sanofi-Aventis, the innovator of Lovenox, may cause delays and additional expense in the commercialization of M-Enoxaparin. If we are not successful in commercializing M-Enoxaparin or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business would be materially harmed, which could include, without limitation, the curtailment of our other development programs.
We will need to develop or acquire additional technologies as part of our efforts to analyze the chemical composition of complex mixture drugs.
Competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our financial results will suffer.
If we are unable to establish and maintain key customer distribution arrangements, sales of our products, and therefore revenues, would decline.
Even if we receive approval to market our drug candidates, the market may not be receptive to our drug candidates upon their commercial introduction, which could prevent us from being profitable.
If we are not able to retain our current management team or attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and business personnel, our business will suffer.
There is a substantial risk of product liability claims in our business. If our existing product liability insurance is insufficient, a product liability claim against us that exceeds the amount of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our business.
As we evolve from a company primarily involved in drug discovery and development into one that is also involved in the commercialization of drug products, we may have difficulty managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.
We may acquire or make investments in companies or technologies that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or cash flows.
Risks Relating to Development and Regulatory Approval
If we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for commercial sale of our generic product candidates, including M-Enoxaparin and M356, as therapeutic equivalents to their corresponding reference listed drugs, our future results of operations will be adversely affected.
If the United States Congress does not take action to create an abbreviated regulatory pathway for follow-on biologics, and if the FDA is not able to establish specific guidelines regarding the scientific analyses required for characterizing follow-on versions of biologics and complex protein drugs, then the uncertainty about the potential value of our glycoprotein program will be increased.
If our preclinical studies and clinical trials for our development candidates, including M118, are not successful, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for commercial sale of our novel or improved drug candidates.
Failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products abroad.
Even if we obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed drugs will be subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we fail to comply with continuing United States and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market drugs and our business would be seriously harmed.
If third-party payors do not adequately reimburse customers for any of our approved products, they might not be purchased or used, and our revenues and profits will not develop or increase.
If efforts by manufacturers of branded products to delay or limit the use of generics are successful, our sales of technology-enabled generic products may suffer.
Federal legislation will increase the pressure to reduce prices of pharmaceutical products paid for by Medicare, which could adversely affect our revenues, if any.
Foreign governments tend to impose strict price or reimbursement controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any.
If we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.
Risks Relating to Patents and Licenses
If we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries, our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will be harmed and we may not be able to operate our business profitably.
Third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, forcing us to expend substantial resources in resulting litigation, the outcome of which would be uncertain. Any unfavorable outcome of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
If we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings to determine or enforce our intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial costs which could adversely affect our business.
We in-license a significant portion of our proprietary technologies and if we fail to comply with our obligations under any of the related agreements, we could lose license rights that are necessary to develop our product candidates.
Risks Relating to Our Dependence on Third Parties
Our 2003 Sandoz Collaboration and 2006 Sandoz Collaboration are important to our business. If Sandoz fails to adequately perform under either collaboration, or if we or Sandoz terminate all or a portion of either collaboration, the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates, including injectable enoxaparin, would be delayed or terminated and our business would be adversely affected.
We may need or elect to enter into alliances or collaborations with other companies to supplement and enhance our own capabilities or fund our development efforts. If we are unsuccessful in forming or maintaining these alliances on favorable terms, or if any collaborative partner terminates or fails to perform its obligations, our business could be adversely affected.
We and our collaborative partners depend on third parties for the manufacture of products. If we encounter difficulties in our supply or manufacturing arrangements, our business may be materially adversely affected.
If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate product revenues.
Our directors, executive officers and major stockholders have substantial influence or control over matters submitted to stockholders for approval that could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.
Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
Our stock price may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.
We could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility, which, if it occurs, will distract our management and could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us.
