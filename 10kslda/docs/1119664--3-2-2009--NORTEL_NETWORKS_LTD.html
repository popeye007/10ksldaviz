                    Risks Relating to Our Creditor Protection Proceedings
We, and many of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, are currently subject to Creditor Protection Proceedings and additional subsidiaries could become subject to similar proceedings. Our business, operations and financial position are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with such proceedings.
Strategic risks, including risks associated with our ability to:
Financial risks, including risks associated with our ability to:
Operational risks, including risks associated with our ability to:
Procedural risks, including risks associated with our ability to:
Continuing or increasing pressure on our business, cash and liquidity could materially and adversely affect our ability to fund and restructure our business operations, react to and withstand the current sustained and expanding economic downturn, as
well as the extraordinarily volatile and uncertain market and industry conditions, and develop and implement a comprehensive restructuring plan. Additional sources of funds may not be available.
We must continue to restructure and transform our business and the assumptions underlying these efforts may prove to be inaccurate. We may not be able to successfully develop, obtain all requisite approvals for, or implement a comprehensive restructuring plan. Failure to obtain the requisite approvals for, or failure to successfully develop and implement our comprehensive restructuring plan within the time granted by the courts would, in all likelihood, lead to the liquidation of all of our assets.
During the pendency of the Creditor Protection Proceedings, our financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends. Also, as a result of the Creditor Protection Proceedings, our internal controls are currently subject to review and modification.
Canadian, U.S. and U.K. laws impair the ability of claimants to take action against us under our existing contracts, including the outstanding notes and related guarantees of us, NNC, NNI and NNCC. Subject to limited exceptions, all actions are stayed and ultimate recoveries cannot be determined at this time.
An increased portion of our cash and cash equivalents may be restricted as cash collateral if we are unable to secure alternative support for certain obligations arising out of our normal course business activities.
If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives, and our ability to successfully emerge from the Creditor Protection Proceedings may be harmed.
Our ability to independently manage our business is restricted during the Creditor Protection Proceedings, and steps or actions in connection therewith may require the approval of the respective courts, the creditors, the Canadian Monitor and the U.K. Administrators.
Transfers or issuances of our equity, or a debt restructuring, may impair or reduce our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future.
Trading in our securities during the pendency of the Creditor Protection Proceedings is highly speculative, poses substantial risks, and is subject to certain restrictions imposed to protect our NOL carryforwards that are described directly above. NNC common shares have been delisted from the NYSE, which has made our stock significantly less liquid; and the TSX may seek to delist our currently listed NNC common shares and NNL preferred shares.
Some or all of the U.S. Debtors could be substantively consolidated.
Risks Relating to Our Business
The sustained and expanding financial crisis and economic downturn could continue to have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and our ability to accurately forecast our results, and it may cause a number of the risks that we currently face to increase in likelihood, magnitude and duration.
We have been and may be further materially and adversely affected by continued cautious capital spending, including as a result of current economic uncertainties, or a change in technology focus by our customers, particularly certain key customers.
Negative developments associated with our suppliers and contract manufacturers, including any inability to maintain stable, normalized relationships with our suppliers on acceptable terms, our reliance on certain suppliers for key optical networking solutions components, and on a sole supplier for the majority of our manufacturing and design functions, as well as consolidation in the industries in which our suppliers operate, may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and customer relationships.
We are fully exposed to market risk primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Adverse fluctuations in these markets could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our business may suffer if our strategic alliances are terminated or are not successful.
Our performance may be materially and adversely affected if our expectations regarding market demand for particular products prove to be wrong.
If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are subject to adverse judgments or settlements arising out of disputes regarding intellectual property rights, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
Defects, errors or failures in our products could result in higher costs than we expect and could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We face significant emerging and existing competition, may not be able to maintain our market share and may suffer from competitive pricing practices.
Rationalization and consolidation among our customers may lead to increased competition and harm our business.
We operate in highly dynamic and volatile industries. If we are unable to develop new products rapidly and accurately predict, or effectively react to, market opportunities, our ability to compete effectively in our industry, and our sales, market share and customer relationships, could be materially and adversely affected.
If we fail to manage the higher operational and financial risks associated with our international operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If we are unable to maintain the integrity of our information systems, our business and future prospects may be harmed.
Changes in regulation of the Internet or other regulatory changes may affect the manner in which we conduct our business and may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our risk management strategy may not be effective or commensurate to the risks we are facing.
We may be required to pay significant penalties or liquidated damages, or our customers may be able to cancel contracts, in the event that we fail to meet contractual obligations including delivery and installation deadlines, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, cash flows and relationships with our customers.
Other Risks Relating to Our Liquidity, Financing Arrangements and Capital
We may need to make larger contributions to our defined benefit plans in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and our ability to meet our other obligations.
Our high level of debt could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
