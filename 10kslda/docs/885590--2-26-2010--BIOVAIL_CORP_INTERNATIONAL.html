                    1. Ability to In-License, Acquire and Develop Products
Our future revenue growth and profitability are dependent upon our ability to in-license or otherwise acquire new specialty CNS compounds or other commercially viable products and to further develop or enhance such products. Our failure to do so successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
a. We will not be able to commercialize our pipeline products if preclinical studies do not produce successful results or if clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans.
b. If clinical trials for our pipeline products are delayed, we may be unable to commercialize our pipeline products on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
c. We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and those service providers may perform in an unsatisfactory manner, such as by failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such trials.
a. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval to sell our pipeline products we would not be able to generate related revenues in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
b. Our marketing, promotional and pricing practices, as well as the manner in which an in-house or third-party sales force interact with purchasers, prescribers and patients, are subject to extensive regulation and any material failure to comply could result in significant sanctions against the Company.
c. We may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting the "off-label" use of drugs.
d. All products manufactured by us or for us by third-party manufacturers must be made in a manner consistent with FDA-mandated, TPD-mandated and ICH-mandated GMP which require substantial expenditures of time, money and effort.
a. Manufacturing difficulties or delays may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
b. If we are unable to optimize the use of or expand our manufacturing facilities or secure cost-effective third-party manufacturing arrangements in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet market demand for our products, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
c. Disruptions of delivery of our products and the routine flow of manufactured goods across the U.S. border could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
d. If we are unable to obtain components or raw materials, or products supplied by third parties, our ability to manufacture and deliver our products to the market may be impeded, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
e. Delays or transition issues arising from the closure of our Dorado, Puerto Rico manufacturing facility may adversely affect our business and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
a. Our approved products may not achieve or maintain expected levels of market acceptance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
b. We may not be able to establish or acquire a U.S. sales force to effectively support our specialty CNS strategy.
c. We may not be able to effectively establish third-party marketing or distribution arrangements.
d. We may experience reductions in the levels of reimbursement for or acceptance of pharmaceutical products by governmental authorities, HMOs or other third-party payors. Any such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
e. A relatively small group of products represents a significant portion of our revenues, gross profit and earnings. If, due to genericization or otherwise, the volume or pricing of any of these products declines or the costs of related manufacturing, distribution or marketing increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
f. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is subject to rapid and significant technological change, which could render our technologies and products obsolete or uncompetitive.
g. We have entered into distribution agreements with other companies to distribute certain of our generic products at supply prices based on net sales. Declines in the pricing and/or volume, over which we have no control, of such generic products, and therefore the amounts paid to us, may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
6. Post-Approval and Post-Marketing Regulatory Impacts
a. Our marketed drugs will be subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we fail to comply with U.S. and Canadian regulatory requirements and those in other territories where our products are sold, we could lose our marketing approvals or be subject to fines or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
b. Our approved products may be subject to additional clinical trials which could result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling or new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy.
a. We may be unable to effectively protect our intellectual and other proprietary property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
b. We may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
a. Our effective tax rates may increase.
a. We are involved in various legal proceedings in the U.S. and Canada and may experience unfavourable outcomes of such proceedings, or of future proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
b. As a public company, we face risks related to class action lawsuits, including threatened litigation.
c. We are subject to exposure relating to product liability claims.
a. We may not be able to refinance the Notes if required or if we so desire.
b. We may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which may affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes on a net-share settlement basis.
c. The issuance of a significant number of our common shares upon conversion of the Notes, or the perception of such issuance, could depress the market price of our common shares.
a. If the companies in which we invest, or with which we partner or co-develop products, are not successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
b. Our continued success is dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain key personnel. Any failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
c. We may not have sufficient cash and may be limited in our ability to access financing for future expenditures, which may prevent us from executing on our CNS strategy and expanding our business and our portfolio of products.
d. The general business and economic conditions in Canada, the U.S. and other countries in which we conduct business could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and capital resources.
e. The current business and economic conditions, coupled with the current regulatory environment, could have a negative impact on the pharmaceutical industry, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
f. We are exposed to risks relating to currency exchanges.
g. We are exposed to risks related to interest rates.
h. Our securities are subject to price volatility.
i. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
j. Rising insurance costs or our inability to obtain insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.
k. We are exposed to risks if we are unable to comply with laws and future changes to laws affecting public companies, including the
("SOX"), and also to increased costs associated with complying with such laws.
