                    We are operating in a market environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. The following risk factors may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and the market price of our stock. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our performance or financial condition.
Risks Related to Our Recent Merger with PowerLight
Although we expect the Merger to be beneficial for us, such benefits may not be realized because of integration difficulties or other challenges.
The completion of the Merger could cause certain solar cell and panel suppliers to reduce or terminate their business relationship with our PowerLight business, which could adversely affect the ability of our PowerLight business to meet customer demand for its solar power systems and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
The completion of the Merger could cause our customers to reduce or terminate their business relationship with us, which could adversely affect our ability to distribute our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
We may be harmed by liabilities arising out of our acquisition of PowerLight and the indemnity they have agreed to provide may be insufficient to compensate us for these damages.
PowerLight will need to obtain certain regulatory and third-party consents as a result of the Merger and, if it cannot obtain these consents, PowerLight s and/or SunPower s business may be harmed.
We expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with the Merger.
Charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting to the Merger may adversely affect the market value of our class A common stock.
Risks Related to Our Business
The solar power industry is currently experiencing an industry-wide shortage of polysilicon. The prices that we pay for polysilicon have increased recently and we expect prices to remain at or above current levels for the foreseeable future, which may constrain the revenue growth and decrease gross margins and profitability for SunPower and PowerLight.
A limited number of the customers of SunPower and PowerLight are expected to continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on us.
SunPower and PowerLight s operating results will be subject to fluctuations and are inherently unpredictable; if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may decline significantly.
SunPower has four solar cell production lines which are located in our manufacturing facilities in the Philippines, and if we experience interruptions in the operation of these production lines or are unable to add additional production lines, it would likely result in lower revenue and earnings than anticipated.
SunPower has recently established a captive solar panel assembly factory, and, if this panel manufacturing factory is unable to produce high quality solar panels at commercially reasonable costs, our revenue growth and gross margin could be adversely affected.
If SunPower does not achieve satisfactory yields or quality in manufacturing our solar cells, our sales could decrease and our relationships with our customers and our reputation may be harmed.
Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for SunPower and PowerLight products.
The reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could cause revenue to decline for SunPower and PowerLight.
Changes in tax laws or fiscal policies may decrease the return on investment for customers of our PowerLight business, and for certain investors in its projects, which could decrease demand for its products and services and harm its business.
Problems with product quality or product performance, including defects, in our solar cells could result in a decrease in customers and revenue, unexpected expenses and loss of market share for SunPower and PowerLight.
Since our SunPower solar panels cannot be tested for the duration of our standard 25-year warranty period, we may be subject to unexpected warranty expense; if SunPower or PowerLight is subject to warranty and product liability claims, such claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
SunPower incurred losses from inception through 2005 and SunPower and PowerLight may not be able to generate sufficient revenue in the future to achieve or sustain profitability.
SunPower and PowerLight will continue to be dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for key components for our products, which could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers within required timeframes, which could result in installation delays, cancellations, liquidated damages and loss of market share.
Any firm commitment supply agreements with solar panel manufacturers could result in insufficient or excess inventory in the PowerLight business.
Acquisitions of other companies or investments in joint ventures with other companies by SunPower or PowerLight could adversely affect our operating results, dilute our stockholders equity, or cause us to incur additional debt or assume contingent liabilities.
SunPower and PowerLight have significant international activities and customers, and plan to continue these efforts, which subject us to additional business risks, including logistical complexity, political instability and currency fluctuations.
A significant portion of the operations for SunPower and PowerLight occur outside the United States. Currency fluctuations in the Euro, Philippine peso or the South Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar could decrease revenue or increase its expenses.
SunPower s current tax holidays in the Philippines will expire within the next several years.
Neither SunPower nor PowerLight may be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.
The steps SunPower has taken to increase the efficiency of our polysilicon utilization are unproven at volume production levels and may not enable us to realize the cost reductions we anticipate.
PowerLight recognized revenue on a percent completion basis and upon the achievement of contractual milestones. We intend to recognize revenue from projects our PowerLight business on a similar basis, and any delay or cancellation of a project could adversely affect our business.
Our PowerLight business sales cycles can be longer than the sales cycle for our solar cells and panels and may require significant upfront investment which may not ultimately result in signing of a sales contract and could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
SunPower depends on a combination of our own wafer-slicing operations and those of other vendors for the wafer-slicing stage of our manufacturing, and any technical problems, breakdowns, delays or cost increases could significantly delay our manufacturing operations, decrease our output and increase our costs.
SunPower obtains capital equipment used in our manufacturing process from sole suppliers and if this equipment is damaged or otherwise unavailable, our ability to deliver products on time will suffer, which in turn could result in order cancellations and loss of revenue.
SunPower and PowerLight generally do not have long-term agreements with our customers and accordingly could lose customers without warning.
Sales contracts for PowerLight s products with increasing frequency have begun to include provisions regarding liquidated damages for installation delays, electricity generation or other solar power system performance guarantees and conditional payments. If they continue, such provisions will put us at economic risk for future uncertain events.
PowerLight prior to the Merger usually acted as the general contractor for its customers in connection with the installations of its solar power systems and was subject to risks associated with cost overruns, delays and other contingencies. We intend to operate the PowerLight business in the same manner, and will be subject to the same risks.
Our PowerLight business could be adversely affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles.
The expansion of our PowerLight business into the residential market may increase its exposure to certain risks, including class action product liability claims.
If SunPower and PowerLight fail to successfully develop and introduce new products and services, we will not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate revenues will suffer; technological changes in the solar power industry could render SunPower s and PowerLight s solar power products uncompetitive or obsolete, which could reduce our market share and cause our sales to decline.
Evaluating SunPower s business and future prospects may be difficult due to our limited history in producing and shipping solar cells and solar panels in commercial volumes.
SunPower and PowerLight s reliance on government programs to partially fund our research and development programs could impair our ability to commercialize our solar power products and services and increase our research and development expenses.
Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than SunPower and PowerLight, we may not be able to compete successfully and we may lose or be unable to gain market share.
SunPower and PowerLight expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures, particularly in our manufacturing facilities, and if adequate funds are not available or if the covenants in our credit agreements impair our ability to raise capital when needed, our ability to expand our manufacturing capacity and our business will suffer.
The demand for products requiring significant initial capital expenditures such as SunPower s and PowerLight s solar power products and services are affected by general economic conditions.
Increases in interest rates may decrease the return on investment for certain customers or investors in projects of PowerLight, which could decrease demand for its products and services and which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
SunPower depends on a third-party subcontractor in China to assemble a majority of our solar cells into solar panels and any failure to obtain sufficient assembly and test capacity could significantly delay our ability to ship our solar panels and damage our customer relationships.
One of PowerLight s key products, PowerTracker , was acquired through an assignment and acquisition of the patents associated with the product from a third party individual, and if we are unable to continue to use this product, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition would be materially harmed.
SunPower and PowerLight are dependent on our intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in the loss of significant rights.
SunPower or PowerLight may file claims against other parties for infringing our intellectual property that may be very costly and may not be resolved in our favor.
We may not be able to prevent others from using the SunPower and PowerLight names or similar marks in connection with their solar power products which could adversely affect the market recognition of our name and our revenue.
SunPower and PowerLight rely primarily upon copyright and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and, if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenue could suffer.
Neither SunPower nor PowerLight may obtain sufficient patent protection on the technology embodied in the solar cells or solar system components we currently manufacture and market, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses.
If the effective term of SunPower s or PowerLight s patents is decreased due to changes in patent laws or if we need to refile some of our patent applications, the value of our patent portfolio and the revenue we derive from products protected by the patents may be decreased.
SunPower s and PowerLight s intellectual property indemnification practices may adversely impact our business.
The success of SunPower s and PowerLight s business depends on the continuing contributions of our key personnel.
Our headquarters for both the SunPower and PowerLight businesses, and other facilities, as well as the facilities of certain of our key subcontractors, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters.
Compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines for SunPower or PowerLight.
SunPower maintains self-insurance for certain indemnities we have made to SunPower s and PowerLight s officers and directors.
Changes to financial accounting standards may affect our combined results of operations and cause SunPower and/or PowerLight to change our business practices.
If SunPower fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.
Our efforts to establish an effective, unified system of internal control over financial reporting with respect to PowerLight could present challenges and we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud on a combined basis.
SunPower faces competition in the market for our imaging detectors and infrared detectors, and if we fail to compete effectively, we will lose or fail to gain market share.
Because of the lengthy sales cycles for SunPower s imaging detectors and the relatively fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses, we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our imaging detectors.
SunPower s debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.
Provisions of SunPower s debentures issued in February 2007 could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.
Risks Related to SunPower s Class A Common Stock
The effect of the issuance of our shares of class A common stock pursuant to the share lending agreement, including sales of our class A common stock in short sale transactions by purchasers of the Debentures, may lower the market price of our class A common stock.
Conversion of the debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their debentures.
Substantial future sales or other dispositions of our class A common stock or other securities could cause our stock price to fall.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The price of our class A common stock, and therefore of the debentures may fluctuate significantly, and a liquid trading market for our class A common stock may not be sustained.
The difference in the voting rights of our class A and our class B common stock may reduce the value and liquidity of our class A common stock.
Delaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.
As a result of SunPower s offering of debentures completed in February 2007, we will have a significant amount of debt. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the debentures and our other debt.
Risks Related to Our Relationship with Cypress Semiconductor Corporation
As long as Cypress controls us, the ability of our other stockholders to influence matters requiring stockholder approval will be limited.
Our ability to continue to manufacture our imaging detectors and our solar cells in our current facilities with our current and planned manufacturing capacities, and therefore to maintain and increase revenue and achieve profitability, depends to a large extent upon the continued success of our relationship with Cypress.
Our historical financial information as a business segment of Cypress may not be representative of our results as an independent public company.
Our ability to operate our business effectively may suffer if we are unable to cost-effectively establish our own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a stand-alone company after the expiration of our services agreements with Cypress.
We may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in our purchasing power and we may have difficulty obtaining new customers due to our relatively small size after our separation from Cypress.
Our agreements with Cypress require us to indemnify Cypress for certain tax liabilities. These indemnification obligations may limit our ability to obtain additional financing or participate in future acquisitions for up to two years.
Third parties may seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of Cypress.
Our inability to resolve any disputes that arise between us and Cypress with respect to our past and ongoing relationships may result in a significant reduction of our revenue.
Some of our directors and executive officers may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of Cypress common stock, options to acquire Cypress common stock and positions with Cypress.
Because Cypress is not obligated to distribute to its stockholders or otherwise dispose of our common stock that it owns, we will continue to be subject to the risks described above relating to Cypress control of us if Cypress does not complete such a transaction.
Cypress ability to replace our board of directors may make it difficult for us to recruit independent directors.
