                    Risks associated with our business
We are a recently formed development stage company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
We may not be able to consummate an initial business combination within the required time frame, in which case, we would be forced to liquidate our assets.
If we are forced to liquidate before an initial business combination and distribute the trust account, our public stockholders may receive less than $8.00 per share and our warrants will expire worthless.
If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination, our public stockholders will be forced to wait until December 6, 2009 before receiving liquidation distributions.
Because there are numerous companies with a business plan similar to ours seeking to effectuate an initial business combination, it may be more difficult for us to do so.
If the funds available to us are insufficient to allow us to operate until December 6, 2009, we may be unable to complete an initial business combination.
If we do not conduct an adequate due diligence investigation of a target business with which we combine, we may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring, and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.
A decline in interest rates could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete an initial business combination since we will depend on interest earned on the trust account to fund our search, to pay our tax obligations and to complete our initial business combination.
If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share liquidation price received by stockholders may be less than approximately $7.97 per share.
Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.
An effective registration statement may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise his, her or its warrants and causing such warrants to expire worthless.
An investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of common stock upon the exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.
Since we have not yet selected any target business with which to complete an initial business combination, we are unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the business operations.
We may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to complete an initial business combination. Issuance of our capital stock would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and may cause a change in control of our ownership, while the issuance of debt securities may have a significant impact on our ability to utilize our available cash.
Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.
Our ability to successfully effect an initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following an initial business combination.
Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following an initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.
Our officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate an initial business combination.
Our officers and directors may in the future become affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
All of our officers and directors own founders shares and some of them own warrants purchased simultaneously with our IPO. These shares and warrants will not participate in liquidation distributions and, therefore, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for an initial business combination.
The American Stock Exchange may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
We may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our IPO, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services.
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses, we will need the acquisitions to be consummated at the same time, thereby making it more difficult for us to consummate a business combination.
We may proceed with an initial business combination even if public stockholders owning approximately 30% of the shares sold in the IPO exercise their conversion rights.
The ability of our stockholders to exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.
We may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.
Because of our limited resources and structure, we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination.
We may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete an initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.
Our founders, including our officers, directors and special advisors, control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.
Our outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to effect an initial business combination.
Our management s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.
If our founders or the holders of the sponsors warrants exercise their registration rights with respect to their founders shares or sponsors warrants and underlying shares, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect an initial business combination.
If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete an initial business combination.
If we effect an initial business combination with a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.
If we effect an initial business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such company will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.
Risks Associated with the Energy and Environmental Industries and Their Related Infrastructures
Fluctuations in energy prices may cause a reduction in the demand or profitability of the products or services we may ultimately produce or offer.
Changes in technology may render our products or services obsolete following a business combination.
Failure to comply with governmental regulations could result in the imposition of penalties, fines or restrictions on operations and remedial liabilities.
If we are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for our operations following a business combination, we may be forced to suspend or cease our operations altogether.
Regulation within the energy industry could reduce our profitability following a business combination.
