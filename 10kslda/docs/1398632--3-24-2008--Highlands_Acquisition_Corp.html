                    We are a recently formed development stage company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
We may not be able to consummate a business combination within the required time frame, in which case, we would be forced to liquidate our assets.
If we are forced to liquidate before a business combination and distribute the trust account, our public stockholders may receive less than $10.00 per share and our warrants will expire worthless.
If we are unable to consummate a business combination, our public stockholders will be forced to wait the full 24 months before receiving liquidation distributions.
You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies.
Because there are numerous companies with a business plan similar to ours seeking to effectuate a business combination and because of our limited resources and structure, it may be more difficult for us to consummate a business combination.
If the net proceeds of our initial public offering not being held in the trust account plus the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be available to us are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 24 months, we may be unable to complete a business combination.
If we do not conduct an adequate due diligence investigation of a target business with which we combine, we may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring, and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.
A decline in interest rates could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete a business combination since we will depend on interest earned on the trust account to fund our search, to pay our tax obligations and to complete our initial business combination.
If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share liquidation price received by stockholders may be less than approximately $9.77 per share.
Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.
An effective registration statement may not be in place when a warrant holder desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such warrant holder from being able to exercise warrants and causing the warrants to expire worthless.
A warrant holder will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of common stock upon the exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.
We have been advised that certain provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may not be enforceable under Delaware law. This could reduce or eliminate the protection afforded to our stockholders by such provisions.
Since we have not yet selected a particular industry or target business with which to complete a business combination, you will be unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the industry or business in which we may ultimately operate.
Your only opportunity to evaluate and affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to voting for or against the business combination submitted to our stockholders for approval.
We may not seek an opinion from an unaffiliated third party as to the fair market value of the target business we acquire or that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view.
We may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to complete a business combination. Issuance of our capital stock would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and may cause a change in control of our ownership, while the issuance of debt securities may have a significant impact on our ability to utilize our available cash.
Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.
Our ability to successfully effect a business combination will be totally dependent upon the efforts and time commitments of our management team, and our ability to be successful after a business combination may be dependent upon the efforts of our management team and key personnel who may join us following a business combination.
Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following a business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.
Some of our officers and directors are now, and our other officers and directors may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and accordingly, have or may have fiduciary or other obligations to these other entities which could create conflicts of interest, including in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
The obligation of our officers and directors to present a business opportunity to us which may be reasonably required to be presented to us under Delaware law is limited and may be subject to pre-existing fiduciary or other obligations that our officers and directors may owe to other companies. Consequently, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will ever present a business combination opportunity to us.
