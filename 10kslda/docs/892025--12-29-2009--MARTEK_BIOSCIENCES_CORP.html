                    Current economic and market conditions could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
A substantial portion of our nutritional oil products sales is made to five of our existing customers under agreements with no minimum purchase requirements. If demand by these customers for our nutritional oil products decreases, our revenues may materially decline.
If we are unable to obtain or maintain patent protection or if our patents do not provide protection or we are unable to obtain comparable protection after patent expiration against competitive products, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
We are aware of several products that are currently available, and products under development, that may present a serious competitive threat to our products. If we are unable to maintain a competitive differentiation from these products, our revenues may be adversely affected.
Experts differ in their opinions on the importance of DHA and/or ARA in infant formula and the levels of DHA and/or ARA required to achieve health benefits for babies. Some experts feel that they are not necessary ingredients for infant development. If clinical trials do not continue to yield positive results, certain favorable regulatory guidelines are not enacted or current favorable regulatory guidelines are amended, our future revenues in the infant formula market may be limited.
Our opportunity in the U.S. infant formula market may be limited by the renewal rate of supplemented formulas into the Women, Infants and Children program or if the eligibility requirements for participating in the program are made more restrictive or if the amount of infant formula offered to participants is reduced.
If our non-infant formula customers do not introduce products containing our nutritional oils on a broad scale into the marketplace and consumers do not purchase such products, our sales to these markets will be limited.
Our oils are very sensitive to oxidation and may not be very compatible with many liquid or dry foods that are currently on the market. If economical methods are not developed to successfully incorporate our oils into various food and beverage applications, we may never be able to gain large-scale entry into the food and beverage and nutritional supplements markets.
If clinical trials do not continue to yield positive results on the benefits of DHA on cognitive function, cardiovascular health or other health applications, our future revenues may be limited in the food and beverage and the dietary supplement markets.
If our oils are unable to be used in organic food and beverage products, the opportunity for sales of our oils into the food and beverage market will be limited to non-organic products.
Because food and beverage pricing is very competitive, the premium that our oils adds to the cost of a food or beverage may never allow it to be priced at levels that will allow acceptance by consumers.
If we are unable to gain or maintain broad regulatory approvals for the incorporation of our oils into foods and beverages worldwide, our future revenues in the food and beverage market may be limited.
If it is determined that large amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid ("EPA") must accompany DHA in order to achieve optimal health benefits, we may never be able to gain large-scale entry into the food and beverage and dietary supplements markets.
If the FDA finalizes its proposed rule to prohibit nutrient content claims for DHA and EPA, our penetration of the food and beverage and dietary supplements markets may be limited.
If the FDA narrowly interprets certain sections of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, such an interpretation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
If we or our customers fail to secure authorized nutrition and health claims within the European Union, future revenues from sales within the European Union could be adversely affected.
We have a single third-party supplier of our ARA with whom we have a contractual relationship. If this supplier of our ARA is unable to supply us with our required amounts of ARA, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
We hold inventory and are committed to significant future inventory purchases. If our inventory on-hand or committed amounts cannot be sold, our results of operations and/or financial position may be adversely affected.
Market fluctuations in the availability and cost of raw materials and energy are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business.
If customer demand for our nutritional oils requires us or our major suppliers to increase production beyond current levels, we may experience certain risks associated with the ramp-up of commercial manufacturing that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
We have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and have incurred substantial costs in doing so. If we are unable to increase our revenues from our nutritional oils produced at these facilities, we may continue to experience excess production capacity and we may be unable to recover these plant expansion costs, which could result in a write-down of certain production assets.
Our business would be harmed if we fail to comply with applicable good manufacturing practices as required by the FDA.
Our manufacturing process involves the handling of hazardous materials and emission of regulated pollutants. If we fail to properly handle these hazardous materials and/or emissions, substantial costs and harm to our business could result.
Our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations.
Our business exposes us to liabilities related to allegedly unsubstantiated product efficacy claims.
Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls, which could adversely impact our financial condition and performance.
Concerns with the safety and quality of our nutritional oils could cause customers to avoid our products.
We may need additional capital in the future to continue our research and development efforts, to conduct product testing, including preclinical and clinical trials, and to market our products. We may also need additional capital to expand our production capacity if market demand for our products continues to grow.
The market price of our common stock may experience a high level of volatility due to factors such as the volatility in the market for biotechnology stocks generally, and the short-term effect of a number of possible events.
If significant shares eligible for future sales are sold, the result may depress our stock price by increasing the supply of our shares in the market at a time when demand may be limited.
If we pursue and ultimately consummate a business combination, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could reduce profitability.
