                    We may delay or reduce our estimated liquidating distributions.
Our co-ownership arrangements with affiliated entities of our Advisor may not reflect solely our beneficiaries best interest and may subject these investments to increased risks.
The downturn in the credit markets may increase the cost of borrowing, and may make it difficult for prospective buyers of the properties to obtain financing, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidation.
Our ability to dispose of our properties and our ability to pay distributions to our beneficiaries are subject to general economic and regulatory factors we cannot control or predict.
If any of the parties to a future sale agreement default thereunder, or if a sale does not otherwise close, our liquidating distributions to our beneficiaries may be delayed or reduced.
Further decreases in property values may reduce the amount that we receive upon the sale of our properties.
If we are unable to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and lease currently available space, if tenants default under their leases or other obligations to us during the liquidation process or if our cash flow during the liquidation is otherwise less than we expect, our liquidating distributions to our beneficiaries may be delayed and/or reduced.
If our liquidation costs or unpaid liabilities are greater than we expect, our liquidating distributions to our beneficiaries may be delayed and/or reduced.
If we are not able to sell our properties in a timely manner, we may experience severe liquidity problems, may not be able to meet our obligations to our creditors and ultimately may become subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
We may be unable to secure funds for future capital improvements, which could adversely impact our ability to attract or retain tenants, and subsequently pay liquidating distributions to our beneficiaries.
Our properties are subject to property taxes that may increase in the future, which could adversely affect our ability to sell our properties and to subsequently pay liquidating distributions to our beneficiaries.
There can be no assurance that the plan of liquidation will result in greater returns to our beneficiaries on their investment within a reasonable period of time, than our beneficiaries would receive through other alternatives reasonably available to us.
We may not be able to receive No-Action Relief from the Staff of the SEC, which could prevent us from maximizing the return to our beneficiaries.
If we are unable to obtain No-Acton Relief from the Staff of the SEC and are unable to sell our remaining assets, we may have to comply fully with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act which could deplete our remaining assets.
If we are not able to receive No-Action Relief from the Staff of the SEC but continue to have beneficiaries, the cost of compliance with the Exchange Act could decrease the proceeds available to our beneficiaries.
Our Trustees may amend the plan of liquidation without further beneficiary approval.
We have the authority to sell our remaining assets under terms less favorable than those assumed for the purpose of estimating our net liquidation value range.
The plan of liquidation may lead to litigation which could result in substantial costs and distract our Trustees.
Our Advisor has conflicts of interest that differ from our beneficiaries interests as a result of the liquidation.
We do not have an executed advisory agreement, and we could lose the services of our Advisor, which may increase operating expenses, and delay or reduce our liquidating distributions.
If our Advisor is unable to retain key executives and employees sufficient to complete the plan of liquidation in a reasonably expeditious manner, our liquidating distributions might be delayed or reduced.
Our beneficiaries may not receive any profits resulting from the sale of our remaining assets, or receive such profits in a timely manner, because we may provide financing to the purchaser of our remaining assets.
Beneficiaries could be liable to the extent of liquidating distributions received from us if contingent reserves are insufficient to satisfy our liabilities.
We may have underestimated the amount of prepayment fees or defeasance charges on our mortgages.
Our beneficiaries may recognize taxable income as a result of the transfer of GREIT s assets and liabilities to us.
The value of our portfolio may be adversely affected by the adoption of the plan of liquidation.
Our adoption of the plan of liquidation caused our accounting basis to change, which could require us to write-down our remaining assets.
We may incur increasingly significant costs in connection with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and we may become subject to liability for any failure to comply.
Other Risks of Our Business
Due to the risks involved in the ownership of real estate, there is no guarantee of any return on our beneficiaries investments and our beneficiaries may lose some or all of their investments.
If our unconsolidated property is unable to generate sufficient funds to pay its expenses, liabilities or distributions, our liquidating distributions to our beneficiaries may be reduced and/or delayed.
Our properties face significant competition.
We depend upon our tenants to pay rent, and their inability to pay rent may substantially reduce our revenues and cash available for distribution to our beneficiaries.
Our use of borrowings on the Congress Center property could result in its foreclosure and unexpected debt service expenses upon refinancing, both of which could have an adverse impact on our operations and cash flow. Additionally, restrictive covenants in our loan documents may restrict our operating activities.
We are dependent upon those tenants that generate significant rental income at our properties, which may have a negative impact on our financial condition if these tenants are unable to meet their rental obligations to us.
Lack of diversification and illiquidity of real estate may make it difficult for us to sell an underperforming property or recover our investment in a property.
Lack of geographic diversity may expose us to regional economic downturns that could adversely impact our operations or our ability to recover our investment in one or more of our properties.
Losses for which we either could not or did not obtain insurance will adversely affect our earnings and we may be unable to comply with insurance requirements contained in mortgage or other agreements due to high insurance costs.
The failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could reduce the amount of cash we have available to pay liquidating distributions.
There is currently no public market for our units of beneficial interest and the units of beneficial interest may not be transferred except by operation of law or upon the death of a beneficiary.
Our properties were purchased at a time when the commercial real estate market was experiencing substantial influxes of capital investment and competition for properties; therefore our properties may not maintain their current value or may further decrease in value.
The conflicts of interest of our Advisor s executives and employees with us mean we will not be managed by our Advisor solely in the best interests of our beneficiaries.
Increases in our insurance rates could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make liquidating distributions to our beneficiaries.
Our consolidated properties depend upon the Texas and California economies and the demand for office space in those states.
Because some of our principal tenants are U.S. government and state agencies, our properties may have a higher risk of terrorist attack than similar properties leased to non-governmental tenants.
We depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our revenues. Any failure by the U.S. government to perform its obligations or renew its leases upon expiration may harm our cash flow and ability to pay liquidating distributions.
An increase in the operating costs of our government-leased properties would harm our cash flow and ability to pay liquidating distributions.
Since our cash flow is not assured, we may not pay distributions in the future.
The absence of arm s length bargaining may mean that our agreements are not as favorable to our beneficiaries as these agreements otherwise would have been.
