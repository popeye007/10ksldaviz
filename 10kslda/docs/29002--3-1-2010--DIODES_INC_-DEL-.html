Delays in initiation of production at facilities, implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, results of operations and financial condition.
We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins.
Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales, which could adversely effect on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation or reductions in quantities ordered could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers demands and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which adversely affect our net sale, market share, results of operations and financial condition.
We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and reduction in our intellectual property rights.
We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner.
If we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to compete, profit margins, results of operations and financial condition.
Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies with complementary product lines or customers. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our products may be found to be defective and, as a result, product liability claims may be asserted against us, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, results of operations and financial condition.
We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing and management personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may not be able to maintain our growth or achieve future growth and such growth may place a strain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If OEMs do not design our products into their applications, a portion of our net sales may be adversely affected.
We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses.
We had a significant amount of debt following the offering of convertible notes. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the notes and or other debt.
Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future.
Our Auction Rate Securities ( ARS ) are currently illiquid, and UBS AG may not honor its part of the settlement agreement with us to purchase our entire ARS portfolio at any time beginning from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012 at par value.
UBS BANK USA ( UBS Bank ) may demand full or partial repayment of our no net cost loan with the UBS Bank at any time at UBS Bank s sole option and without cause, and UBS Financial Services Inc. may be unable to provide us any alternative financing on substantially same terms and conditions as those of the no net cost loan.
The value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities is based on estimates and assumptions, which may prove inaccurate and the actual amount of expenses recorded in the consolidated financial statements could differ materially from the assumptions used.
Due to the recent fluctuations in the United Kingdom s equity markets and bond markets, changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plan s asset value, require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
There are risks associated with previous and future acquisitions. We may ultimately not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock.
Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the United States or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations and financial condition.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

We have significant operations and assets in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and England and, as a result, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our financial performance.

We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations.
We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our net income.
The distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the United States may be subject to U.S. income taxes, thus reducing our net income.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK
Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile.
We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.
Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our Common Stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters.
We were formed in 1959, and our early corporate records are incomplete. As a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our Common Stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete.
Conversion of our convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including stockholders who had previously converted their notes.
Non-cash tender offers, debt equity swaps or equity exchanges to consummate our business activities are likely to have the effect of diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including qualified stockholders who receive shares of our common stock in such business activities.
The repurchase rights and the increased conversion rate triggered by a make-whole fundamental change could discourage a potential acquirer.
