Pricing for advertising may continue to face downward pressure.
Costs to acquire advertising inventory could continue to increase.

Availability of SDV technology may not enable TWC to effectively manage its existing bandwidth.
The Internal Revenue Service and state and local tax authorities may challenge the tax characterizations of the Adelphia Acquisition, the Redemptions or the Exchange, or related valuations, and any successful challenge by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities could materially adversely affect Time Warner s tax profile, significantly increase its future cash tax payments and significantly reduce its future earnings and cash flow.
TWC may encounter unforeseen difficulties as it increases the scale of its video, high-speed data and voice offerings to commercial customers.
TWC s business is subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could adversely affect its business.
Net neutrality legislation or regulation could limit TWC s ability to operate its high-speed data business profitably, to manage its broadband facilities efficiently and to make upgrades to those facilities sufficient to respond to growing bandwidth usage by its high-speed data customers.
RISKS RELATING TO BOTH THE TIME WARNER NETWORKS AND FILMED ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES
The Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments must respond to recent and future changes in technology, services and standards to remain competitive and continue to increase their revenue.
The Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments operate in highly competitive industries.
Although piracy poses risks to several of Time Warner s businesses, such risks are especially significant for the Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments due to the prevalence of piracy of feature films and television programming.

The costs of producing and marketing feature films have increased and may increase in the future, which may make it more difficult for a film to generate a profit.
Changes in estimates of future revenues from feature films could result in the write-off or the acceleration of the amortization of film production costs.
A decrease in demand for television product could adversely affect Warner Bros. revenues.
RISKS RELATING TO TIME WARNER S NETWORKS BUSINESS
The loss of affiliation agreements could cause the revenue of the Networks segment to decline in any given period, and further consolidation of multichannel video programming distributors could adversely affect the segment.
The inability of the Networks segment to license rights to popular programming or create popular original programming could adversely affect the segment s revenue.
Increases in the costs of programming licenses and other significant costs may adversely affect the gross margins of the Networks segment.
The maturity of the U.S. video services business, together with rising retail rates, distributors focus on selling alternative products and other factors, could adversely affect the future revenue growth of the Networks segment.
