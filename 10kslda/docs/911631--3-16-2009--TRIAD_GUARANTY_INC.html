                    If the Division does not believe that our financial and operating plan is likely to produce a solvent run-off, it may appoint a conservator or liquidator of Triad for the protection of its existing policyholders. Any receivership proceeding involving Triad could effectively eliminate all value associated with the parent company s ownership of Triad.
Under terms of the Corrective Order with the Division and the terms of the original surplus note, Triad is prohibited from making interest payments on its $25 million surplus note to the holding company. If the financial condition of Triad continues to deteriorate, then the Division will be unable to lift that restriction for the foreseeable future, which would jeopardize the ability of the holding company to make the required interest payments on its $35 million outstanding long-term debt.
There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is currently listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market. The NASDAQ Stock Market has certain continued listing requirements regarding public float, minimum bid price, and net worth, among others. If we are unable to meet these continued listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted in which case trading would be available only in over-the-counter markets and stockholder liquidity would be adversely affected.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were both placed under the conservatorship of FHFA, an agency of the United States Government in 2008. They are currently in the process of re-examining their capitalization, business practices, rules surrounding modifications of existing mortgages, and other items that could impact our business during run-off. Changes in the business practices or legislation relating to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could significantly impact our results in run-off.
Risks Related to Economic Conditions
If deteriorating economic conditions alter the frequency and severity patterns utilized in our estimates for reserves for losses, we may be required to take additional charges to results of operations.
Consistent with industry practice, we provide reserves only for loans in default that have been reported to us rather than on our estimate of the ultimate loss. As such, our results of operations in certain periods could be disproportionately affected by the timing of reported defaults.
During 2008 the United States housing market experienced a significant amount of home price depreciation, which had a direct negative impact on our loss reserves and paid claims during 2008. If home prices continue to decline on a more significant or larger geographic basis than what we experienced in 2008, we may incur a higher level of losses from paid claims and also be required to increase our loss reserves.
Because a significant portion of our business is sensitive to interest rates, a large increase in rates would cause higher monthly mortgage payments for borrowers that could potentially lead to a greater number of defaults, which would adversely impact our business.
Geographic concentration of our risk in force in certain distressed markets has resulted in increased defaults and higher risk in default from the significantly larger loans in these states. Ongoing house price depreciation in these distressed markets could lead to further increases in reserves and paid claims, which could further negatively impact our financial performance.
We experienced a significant increase in reported defaults and paid claims during 2008. If the pace of declining home prices and ongoing credit problems in the mortgage marketplace continues or remains unsettled, we anticipate an increased number of defaults and paid claims, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.
Due to the fact that we are in run-off and cannot replace our existing business, an extended period of low mortgage interest rates and relaxed credit terms for our existing borrowers could lead to increased refinance activity that could have a negative impact on persistency, which would lead ultimately to reduced premiums.
A large portion of our insurance in force consists of loans with high loan-to-value ratios, which could result in a greater number of defaults and larger claims than loans with lower loan-to-value ratios during periods of declining home prices.
Because we generally cannot cancel mortgage insurance policies or adjust renewal premiums due to changing economic conditions, unanticipated defaults and claims could cause our financial performance to suffer significantly.
Our loss experience is likely to increase as our policies continue to age.
Insurance written under our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims.
If we failed to properly underwrite mortgage loans when we provided contract underwriting services, we may be required to provide monetary and other remedies to the customer.
If many of our lender partners for which we have entered into risk-sharing agreements, such as captive reinsurance treaties, continue under financial stress for an extended period of time, then the ability of these lenders to meet their financial obligations under the captive reinsurance treaties may be limited to the trust balances maintained within the reinsurance structures, which could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations.
We have not recorded any of the benefits or liabilities of the $95 million Excess of Loss reinsurance treaty in our GAAP financial statements. If we are unsuccessful in our arbitration hearings with the reinsurer, this could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to complete a successful run-off.
Loan servicers have recently experienced a significant increase in their workload due to the rapid growth in defaults and foreclosures. If the loan servicer fails to act proactively with delinquent borrowers in an effort to avoid foreclosure, then the number of delinquent loans eventually going to claim status could increase.
Triad is operating in run-off under a Corrective Order from the Division and the outlook for the entire mortgage insurance industry remains uncertain. Maintaining experienced staff is critical to achieving a successful run-off.
