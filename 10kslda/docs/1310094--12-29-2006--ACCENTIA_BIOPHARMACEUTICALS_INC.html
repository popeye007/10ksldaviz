                    Risks Related to Our Business
We are largely dependent on the success of our two most significant product candidates, SinuNase and BiovaxID, and we may not be able to successfully commercialize these therapies.
If we fail to obtain FDA approval of SinuNase, BiovaxID, or any of our other current or future product candidates, we will be unable to commercialize these products.
Before we can seek regulatory approval of SinuNase, BiovaxID, or any other product candidates, we may need to successfully complete clinical trials, outcomes of which are uncertain.
We have incurred significant costs in our development efforts to date and may never generate significant revenues from commercial sales of our product candidates, if approved.
We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in the future, and if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
We cannot predict the impact, if any, that Fast-Track status will have on the regulatory approval process for SinuNase and BiovaxID.
Failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials may cause delays in developing SinuNase, BiovaxID, or any other product candidate.
Our clinical trials for SinuNase and/or BiovaxID may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or preclinical testing for these product candidates or cease our trials.
The clinical trials for SinuNase and BiovaxID have demonstrated that certain side effects may be associated with these treatments, and ongoing or future clinical trials may reveal additional unexpected or unanticipated side effects.
If we do not in the future obtain a license from MAYO for antifungals other than amphotericin B in the treatment of CRS, then MAYO will not be precluded from licensing its patented CRS therapy to third-parties using other antifungals.
Delays in clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenue.
Inability to obtain regulatory approval for our manufacturing facility or to manufacture on a commercial scale may delay or disrupt our commercialization efforts.
We have been denied orphan drug exclusivity for BiovaxID, and our competitors may obtain orphan drug exclusivity.
The commercialization of our product candidates may not be profitable.
We have no experience manufacturing BiovaxID or any other immunotherapies for the number of patients and at a cost that would enable widespread commercial use.
We may experience difficulties in manufacturing BiovaxID or in obtaining approval of the change in manufacturing site from the FDA, which could prevent us from completing our ongoing clinical trials and delay the commercialization of BiovaxID.
We are dependent on third-party development partners for the development and regulatory approval of some of our products and on third-party contract manufacturers for the supply of many of our products.
Some of our specialty pharmaceutical products are not the subject of FDA-approved new drug applications.
If we fail to enter into and maintain successful strategic relationships for our product candidates, we may have to reduce or delay our product candidate development or increase our expenditures.
If we acquire other complementary technologies or companies, our financial performance could suffer, and such acquisitions involve a number of risks.
We are not able to prevent third parties, including potential competitors, from developing and selling an anti-cancer vaccine for NHL having the same composition of matter as BiovaxID.
Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates.
We may find it difficult to prevent compounding pharmacies from preparing compounded formulations of amphotericin B solution for the treatment of CRS in violation of the patents that we license.
If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome would have a significant adverse effect on our business.
If federal or state enforcement authorities characterize any portion of the fees payable to us by sublicenses of our CRS therapy as remuneration for recommending or referring business to the compounding pharmacies, then such fees could be challenged under federal and/or state anti-kickback laws.
The revenues that we receive from sublicensing the amphotericin B therapy for CRS to compounding pharmacies could be materially adversely impacted by FDA enforcement action.
Physicians may be reluctant to prescribe amphotericin B for treatment of CRS while it is an unapproved indication.
We currently depend on a sole-source supplier for KLH, a critical raw material used in the manufacture of BiovaxID, and physicians who administer BiovaxID depend on a sole-source supplier for GM-CSF, an immune system stimulant administered with BiovaxID.
The market may not be receptive to our products upon their introduction.
The National Cancer Institute is not precluded from working with other companies on developing products that are competitive with BiovaxID.
Risks Related to Our Industry
Our competitors may develop products that are less expensive, safer, or more effective, which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any future products that we may commercialize.
If we fail to comply with extensive regulations enforced by the FDA, EMEA, and other agencies, the sale of our current products, and the commercialization of our product candidates would be prevented or delayed.
The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain and failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.
We may not be able to maintain sufficient product liability insurance to cover claims against us.
We could be negatively impacted by the application or enforcement of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws and other federal and state anti-referral laws.
Risk Factors Related to Our Operations
The failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could impair our product development and commercialization efforts.
We expect to expand our development, clinical research, and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.
We have a limited operating history and financial results are uncertain.
Our relationship with BioDelivery Sciences and the relationship of several of our senior executive officers to BioDelivery Sciences creates potential for conflicts of interest.
The existence of minority stockholders in our Biovest subsidiary creates potential for conflicts of interest.
A total of 18 million shares of the Biovest stock held by us is transferable under debentures and warrants issued by us.
We occasionally become subject to commercial disputes that could harm our business by distracting our management from the operation of our business, by increasing our expenses and, if we do not prevail, by subjecting us to potential monetary damages and other remedies.
Two of our customers generate a large portion of our revenue, and any reduction, delay, or cancellation of orders from these customers could reduce our revenues.
Our level of indebtedness reduces our financial flexibility and could impede our ability to operate.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
Our stock price may be volatile, and your investment in our stock could decline in value.
If the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in entrenchment of management or conflicts of interest that could cause our stock price to decline.
Future sales of our common stock could lower the market price of our common stock
Evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty.
We have limited experience attempting to comply with public company obligations, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
We have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Some provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, bylaws, and Florida law may inhibit potential acquisition bids that you may consider favorable.
