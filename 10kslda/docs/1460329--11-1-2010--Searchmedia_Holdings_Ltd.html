                    We have been unable, to date, to integrate our acquisitions, and such inability could materially and adversely impact our operations and our ability to detect and prevent financial irregularities.
There may be additional risks inherent in the past acquisitions made by SearchMedia International before the Business Combination, which could materially and adversely affect our business and growth prospects and cause us to not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.
Deterioration of economic conditions and a resulting decrease in demand for advertising services would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and limit our growth prospects.
A business strategy of making acquisitions subjects us to all of the risks inherent in identifying, acquiring and operating newly acquired businesses.
Failure to manage our growth could strain our management, operational and other resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and growth potential.
Future charges due to possible impairments of acquired assets may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
We face significant competition for advertising spending from operators of new and traditional advertising networks. If we cannot successfully compete, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.
We have a limited operating history which may make it difficult for you to evaluate our business and prospects.
If we fail to develop and maintain relationships with site owners, managers and sublessors that provide us access to desirable locations and network platforms, our growth potential and our business could be harmed.
Failures to obtain site owners consents or objections from site owners to the installations of our media products could lead to termination of our contracts or installations, which would harm our results of operations.
If we are unable to obtain or retain desirable placement locations for our advertising poster frames and outdoor billboards on commercially advantageous terms, our operating margins and earnings could decrease and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
We may not have sufficient liquidity to pay earn-out payments when they come due, which could materially and adversely affect our operations.
The shareholders of Jingli Shanghai may have potential conflicts of interest with us.
Our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.
If we are unable to adapt to changing advertising trends of advertisers and consumers, we will not be able to compete effectively and we will be unable to increase or maintain our revenues, which may materially and adversely affect our business prospects and revenues.
Our growth could suffer if we fail to expand our media networks to include new media offerings, media platforms or enter into new markets.
If site managers or owners shut down our displays for site maintenance or other reasons, our business could be adversely affected.
Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
We rely on computer software and hardware systems in managing our operations; any failure in these systems could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have no business liability, disruption or litigation insurance, and we could incur substantial costs if our business is disrupted due to natural disasters, litigation or other business interruptions.
Our operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate from period to period.
Jieli Network has not started its operation, which could cause Jieli Network to lose its business license.
Risks Relating to Doing Business in the People s Republic of China
If the PRC government determines that the contractual arrangements that establish the structure for operating our China business do not comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties.
We rely on contractual arrangements with Jingli Shanghai and its shareholders for our China operations, which may not be as effective in providing operational control as would be the case through ownership of a controlling equity interest in such operating entities.
Our affiliated entity may have engaged in business activities without necessary registration with local authorities. This could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.
Adverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business.
If advertising registration certificates are not obtained for advertisements on our outdoor billboard or rapid transit networks, we may be subject to fines.
Our outdoor billboards, light boxes and neon signs are subject to municipal zoning requirements, governmental approvals and administrative controls. If we are required to tear down our billboards, light boxes or neon signs as a result of these requirements, approvals or controls, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.
If we were deemed a resident enterprise by PRC tax authorities, we could be subject to tax on our global income and our non-PRC shareholders could be subject to certain PRC taxes.
We principally rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries and affiliated entities to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.
Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us.
We may be subject to, and may expend significant resources in defending against, government actions and civil suits based on the content and services we provide through our network.
Governmental control of currency conversion may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. Substantial limitations may be imposed on the removal of funds from the PRC to the Company, or the infusion of funds by us to our subsidiaries and affiliates located in the PRC.
PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose vehicles by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident shareholders or us to penalties and limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute profits to us, or otherwise adversely affect us.
PRC regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of the business combination to make loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC operating subsidiaries and affiliated entities.
Fluctuation in the value of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on your investment.
Any health epidemics and other outbreaks, or war, acts of terrorism and other man -made or natural disasters could severely disrupt our business operations.
We are a Cayman Islands company and, because the rights of shareholders under Cayman Islands law differ from those under U.S. law, you may have fewer protections as a shareholder.
Our Board of Directors is subject to potential deadlock.
As a foreign private issuer, we will be exempt from certain SEC requirements that provide stockholders with protections and information that must be made available to stockholders of U.S. public companies.
Because we do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our ordinary shares only if those shares appreciate in value.
Voting control by executive officers, directors and other affiliates of the company may limit your ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring shareholder approval.
The NYSE Amex may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
A significant number of shares will become eligible for future sale by our stockholders and the sale of those shares could adversely affect the stock price
There is a risk that we could be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the Business Combination, which could result in significantly greater U.S. federal income tax liability to us.
There is a risk that we will be classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of ordinary shares or warrants of SearchMedia.
If you acquire (directly, indirectly, or constructively) 10% or more of our shares, you may be subject to taxation under the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC rules.
Risks Relating to Our Stockholders and Warrantholders
We may choose to redeem our outstanding warrants at a time that is disadvantageous to the warrantholders, preventing such holders from realizing the potential economic value of their warrants.
Our warrantholders may not be able to exercise their warrants, which may significantly reduce their economic value and create liability for us.
