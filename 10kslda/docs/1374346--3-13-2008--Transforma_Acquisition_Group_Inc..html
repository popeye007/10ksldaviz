                    Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination.
If we do not consummate a business combination and are forced to dissolve, payments from the trust account to our public stockholders may be delayed.
Upon distribution of the trust account following our dissolution and liquidation, our stockholders may be held liable for claims of third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.
We are a development stage company with no operating history and, accordingly, you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
If the net proceeds from our initial public offering not placed in the trust account and our share of the interest earned on the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for 24 months from our initial public offering, we may not be able to complete a business combination.
A significant portion of our working capital could be expended in pursuing business combinations that are not consummated.
You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies.
If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share liquidation price received by stockholders may be less than the $7.88 per share held in trust.
Under Delaware law, the requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended, which could reduce or eliminate the protection afforded to our stockholders by such requirements and restrictions.
Because we have not yet selected any acquisition target with which to complete a business combination, we are unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the business operations.
There may be tax consequences associated with our acquisition, holding and disposition of target companies and assets.
We may issue shares of our capital stock to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.
We may issue debt securities, which could limit our ability to operate our business and return value to our stockholders.
Our ability to successfully consummate a business combination and to be successful thereafter will be dependent upon the efforts of our management.
The loss of any of our executive officers could adversely affect our ability to operate.
Our executive officers and directors will allocate some portion of their time to other businesses, thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination.
Our executive officers and directors currently are, and may in the future become affiliated with additional entities that are, engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
If we seek to effect a business combination with an entity that is directly or indirectly affiliated with one or more of our executive officers and directors, conflicts of interest could arise.
Any attempt to consummate more than one transaction as our initial business combination will make it more difficult to consummate our initial business combination.
We may combine with an acquisition target with a history of poor operating performance and there is no guarantee that we will be able to improve the operating performance of that acquisition target.
We may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of an acquisition target, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.
The 3,124,997 shares of common stock owned by our founders will not participate in liquidation distributions, and a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular acquisition target is appropriate for a business combination.
If our common stock becomes subject to the SEC s penny stock rules, broker-dealers may experience difficulty in completing customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.
Initially, we may only be able to complete one business combination, which may cause us to be solely dependent on a single business and a limited number of products or services.
The ability of our stockholders to exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to consummate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.
Our founders, including all of our officers and directors, control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.
The exercise by our founders of their registration rights, and/or by CRT Capital Group LLC of its purchase option and registration rights, may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and the existence of the registration rights and CRT Capital Group LLC s purchase option may make it more difficult to effect a business combination.
A market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.
If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to consummate a business combination, or we may be required to incur additional expenses if we are unable to dissolve after the expiration of the allotted time periods.
We may or may not obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party as to the fair market value of the acquisition target or that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our stockholders.
The American Stock Exchange may require us to file an additional listing application on the consummation of a business combination, and/or the American Stock Exchange may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to effect transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
An effective registration statement may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise his warrants and causing such warrants to be worthless.
We may choose to redeem our outstanding warrants at a time that is disadvantageous to our warrant holders.
Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.
Risks Related to Doing Business Outside the United States
Since we may acquire an acquisition target that is located outside the United States, we may encounter risks specific to one or more countries in which we ultimately operate.
Foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Because we must furnish our stockholders with acquisition target financial statements prepared in accordance with and reconciled to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we will not be able to complete a business combination with some prospective acquisition targets unless their financial statements are first reconciled to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Risks Associated with the Technology, Media and Telecommunications Industries
Our investments in technology, media and telecommunications companies may be extremely risky due, in part, to market conditions, and we could lose all or part of our investments.
The information available regarding technology, media and telecommunications companies is limited which could result in poor investment decisions on our part and we could lose all or part of our investments.
If we make an investment in a technology, media and telecommunications company that is dependent on current management, the loss of such management may materially affect results of operations.
The technology, media and telecommunications industries are highly cyclical, which may materially affect our future performance and ability to sell our products or services and, in turn, hurt our profitability.
If we are unable to keep pace with the changes in the technology, media and telecommunications industries, the products of any acquisition target that we acquire could become obsolete and it could materially hurt our results of operations.
We may be unable to protect or enforce the intellectual property rights of any acquisition targets that we acquire.
The technology, media and telecommunications industries are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively which could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability upon consummation of a business combination.
We may be subject to significant regulatory requirements in connection with our efforts to consummate a business combination with a company in the media and telecommunications industries, which may result in our failure to consummate our initial business combination within the required time frame and may force us to liquidate.
