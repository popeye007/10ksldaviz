                    Uncertainty of Future Growth and Profitability. Our future growth and profitability will depend on a number of factors.
Dependence on General Economic Conditions and Consumer Spending . We are highly dependent on discretionary consumer spending. Adverse trends in general economic conditions, including in particular the housing market, retail shopping patterns, consumer confidence, credit markets and employment levels, may continue to adversely affect our sales, profitability and financial condition.
Effectiveness and Efficiency of Marketing and Advertising . Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness of our marketing messages and the efficiency of our advertising expenditures and other marketing programs in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products.
Dependence on Internet Marketing Programs . Our future growth and profitability will depend in part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our internet-based advertising programs and upon the prominence of our Web site URLs on internet search engine results.
Uncertainty of Consumer Acceptance . Our products represent a significant departure from traditional innerspring mattresses and the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance would harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.
Dependence on Availability of Consumer Credit . More than one-third of our net sales are financed under a consumer credit program provided by a third party. The termination of this consumer credit program, any material change to the terms of this consumer credit program or in the availability or terms of credit offered to our customers under this consumer credit program, or any delay in securing replacement credit sources, could harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.
Risks of Retail Store Distribution Strategy . Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon our ability to execute our retail store distribution strategy, including increasing sales and profitability through our existing company-controlled stores, which carry significant fixed costs, and cost-effectively closing under-performing stores. If we are unable to regain growth in sales through our company-controlled stores, we may be required to incur significant costs to close underperforming stores, which could harm our profitability and financial condition.
Risks of Wholesale Distribution Strategy . We have established wholesale relationships with a limited number of mattress retailers and with the QVC shopping channel. These relationships may not yield the benefits we expect and may adversely impact sales through our company-controlled distribution channels. The loss of a significant wholesale account or the loss of distribution through QVC could adversely impact our sales, profitability and financial condition.
Dependence on Key Suppliers . We rely upon several key suppliers that are, in some instances, the only source of supply currently used by the company for particular materials or components. The failure of one or more of these suppliers or our other key suppliers to supply materials or components for our products on a timely basis, or a material change in the purchase terms for the materials or components, could harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.
Inflationary Pressures . Increases in commodity prices, component costs and/or delivery costs could harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.
Risks of Just-In-Time Manufacturing Processes . We utilize just-in-time manufacturing processes with minimal levels of raw materials, work in process and finished goods inventories, which could leave us vulnerable to shortages of supply of key components. Any such shortage could result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner and lost sales, which could harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.
Risks of Foreign Sourcing of Materials . The foreign manufacturing of our air chambers and some of our other components involves risks that could increase our costs, lead to inadequate inventory levels or delays in shipping beds to our customers, which could harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.
Dependence on UPS and Other Carriers . We depend upon UPS and other carriers to deliver some of our products to customers on a timely and cost-effective basis. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns and cause us to lose sales. Any increase in freight charges could increase our costs of doing business and harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.
Risk of Damage to our Manufacturing Facilities . Damage to either of our manufacturing facilities could increase our costs of doing business or lead to delays in shipping our beds, which could result in increased returns and adversely affect future sales.
Competition . The mattress industry is highly competitive. Our business could be harmed by existing competitive pressures or from one or more new entrants into the market.
Need for Continuous Product Improvement . If we are unable to enhance our existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to regain growth in sales or improvement in profitability.
Risks of Compliance with Governmental Regulations . We are subject to a wide variety of government regulations. Any failure to comply with any of these regulations could harm our business, reputation, sales, profitability and financial condition. We may be required to incur significant expenses or to modify our operations in order to ensure compliance with these regulations.
Risks of Compliance with Flammability Standards . All mattresses and mattress and foundation sets, including ours, became subject to new federal flammability standards and related regulations in July 2007. Compliance with these regulations has increased our product costs, has required modifications to our systems and operations and may increase the risk of disruptions to our business due to ongoing testing to assure compliance or due to regulatory inspections.
Risks of Compliance with Safety Standards . All children s products, including some mattresses, are subject to new consumer product safety standards. Compliance with these regulations may increase our product costs and may require modifications to our systems and operations.
Risks of Seasonal Influences . Our business is subject to seasonal influences and a substantial portion of our net sales is often realized in the last month or last few weeks of a quarter, due in part to our promotional schedule and commission structure. As our marketing expenditures are largely based on our expectations of future customer inquiries and net sales, and cannot be adjusted quickly, a failure to meet these expectations may harm our profitability and financial condition.
Product Returns and Warranty Claims . Significant and unexpected return rates under our 30-night trial period, or significant and unexpected warranty claims under our 20-year limited warranty, could harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.
Exposure to Product Liability Claims . We may face exposure to product liability claims.
Protection of Our Intellectual Property . If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent other companies from using our technology in competitive products.
Dependence on Management and Other Key Employees . The loss of the services of any members of our executive management team could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy and growth initiatives and could harm our business.
NASDAQ Listing Requirements . Failure to satisfy NASDAQ Global Select Market listing requirements may result in our common stock being removed from listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
Risks of International Distribution . Through relationships with other parties, we distribute products in Canada and Australia, which presents some additional risks to our business.
Risks of Terrorist Attacks . Additional terrorist attacks in the United States or against U.S. targets, or acts of war or threats of war or the escalation of current hostilities involving the United States or its allies could adversely impact our sales, profitability, financial condition or stock price in unpredictable ways.
Risks of Pandemic . An outbreak of Avian Flu or a pandemic, or the threat of a pandemic, may adversely impact our ability to produce and deliver our products or may adversely impact consumer demand.
