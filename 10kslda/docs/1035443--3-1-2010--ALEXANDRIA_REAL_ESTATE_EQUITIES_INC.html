                    The global financial crisis, and other events or circumstances beyond the control of the Company, may adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations, contractual commitments, and access to capital.
There can be no assurance that actions of the United States Government, Federal Reserve, and other government and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will achieve the intended effect.
Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented.
We may not be able to obtain additional capital to further our business objectives.
Possible future sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect its market price.
The price per share of our stock may fluctuate significantly.
The market price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including:
the availability of debt and/or equity capital;
the condition of our balance sheet;
the condition of the financial and banking industries;
actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends;
the amount and timing of debt maturities and other contractual obligations;
changes in our FFO or earnings estimates;
the publication of research reports about us, the real estate industry, or the life science industry;
the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other debt or equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate-based companies);
general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;
changes in our analyst ratings;
changes in market valuations of similar companies;
adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;
additions or departures of key management personnel;
speculation in the press or investment community;
terrorist activity adversely affecting the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending;
government regulatory action and changes in tax laws;
the realization of any of the other risk factors included in this annual report on Form 10-K; and
general market and economic conditions.
Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects.
Our debt service obligations may have adverse consequences on our business operations.
We may not be able to refinance our debt and/or our debt may not be assumable.
We may not be able to borrow additional amounts under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan.
Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict our ability to engage in some business activities.
We could become highly leveraged and our debt service obligations could increase.
If interest rates rise, our debt service costs will increase and the value of our properties may decrease.
Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.
We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through partnerships, limited liability companies and joint ventures.
The conversion rights of our
unsecured convertible notes may be detrimental to holders of our common stock.
As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $368.0 million, net of $16.7 million discount, outstanding on our unsecured convertible notes with a coupon of 3.70% (the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes ).
The conversion rights of our 8.00% unsecured convertible notes may be detrimental to holders of our common stock.
The conversion rights of our convertible preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock.
We may not be able to sell our properties quickly to raise money.
If our revenues are less than our expenses, we may have to borrow additional funds and we may not be able to make distributions to our stockholders.
Our distributions to stockholders may decline at any time.
Distributions on our common stock may be made in the form of cash, stock, or a combination of both
We may be unsuccessful with our real estate development and redevelopment activities.
We have spaces available for redevelopment that may be difficult to redevelop or successfully lease to tenants.
Improvements to life science properties are significantly more costly than traditional office space.
We could default on leases for land on which some of our properties are located or held for future development.
We may not be able to operate properties successfully.
We may experience increased operating costs, which may reduce profitability.
Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses including cleaning, electricity, HVAC, administrative costs and other costs associated with security, landscaping and repairs and maintenance of our properties.
However, we cannot be certain that our tenants will be able to bear the full burden of these higher costs, or that such increased costs will not lead them, or other prospective tenants, to seek space elsewhere. If operating expenses increase, the availability of other comparable space in the markets we operate in may hinder or limit our ability to increase our rents; if operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
We face substantial competition in our target markets.
Poor economic conditions in our markets could adversely affect our business.
We are largely dependent on the life science industry for revenues from lease payments.
Our tenants may not be able to pay us if they are unsuccessful in discovering, developing, making or selling their products and technologies.
Our inability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire may significantly affect our business.
The inability of a tenant to pay us rent could adversely affect our business.
government tenants may not receive annual budget appropriations, which could adversely affect their ability to pay us.
We could be held liable for damages resulting from our tenants use of hazardous materials.
Our properties may have defects that are unknown to us.
We may incur significant costs complying with the Americans With Disabilities Act and similar laws.
We may incur significant costs if we fail to comply with laws or if laws change.
We could incur significant costs complying with environmental laws.
Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs to remedy the problem.
We could incur significant costs due to the financial condition of our insurance carriers.
Our insurance may not adequately cover all potential losses.
Terrorist attacks may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets.
The loss of services of any of our senior executive officers could adversely affect us.
If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be taxed at corporate rates and would not be able to take certain deductions when computing our taxable income.
We may change our business policies without stockholder approval.
Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.
Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may also incur additional significant costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.
There are limits on the ownership of our capital stock under which a stockholder may lose beneficial ownership of its shares and which may delay or prevent transactions that might otherwise be desired by our stockholders.
In addition to the ownership limit, certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that may be deemed to be desirable to our stockholders.
External factors may adversely impact the valuation of investments.
We face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.
We have certain ownership interests outside the United States that may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations.
We are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the United States dollar and foreign currencies.
