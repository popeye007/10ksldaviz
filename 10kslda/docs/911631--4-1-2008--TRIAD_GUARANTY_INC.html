                    If we implement a run-off plan and our business is limited to servicing our remaining book of in-force insurance, we face additional regulatory and operating risks that could reduce or eliminate the market value of our common stock.
If further negative rating agency actions result in our inability to qualify as a Type 1 insurer under existing and proposed Fannie Mae guidelines, or as a Type I insurer under existing and proposed Freddie Mac guidelines, effectively we would be unable to write new business.
If our risk-to-capital ratio continues to increase, we could face adverse regulatory and rating agency action and be in violation of covenants in our credit agreements, which would adversely impact our ability to write new business.
If we fail to meet the various minimum required levels or maintain designated financial ratios detailed in the regulations of the states in which we write business, we could be declared to be in a hazardous financial condition, which could ultimately lead to restricting future business in those states.
Changes in the business practices or legislation relating to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could significantly impact our business.
Legislation and regulatory changes, including changes impacting the GSEs, could significantly affect our business and could reduce demand for private mortgage insurance.
Risks Related to Economic Conditions
If deteriorating economic conditions alter the frequency and severity patterns utilized in our estimates for reserves for losses, we may be required to take additional charges to results of operations.
Consistent with industry practice, we provide reserves only for loans in default that have been reported to us rather than on our estimate of the ultimate loss. As such, our results of operations in certain periods could be disproportionately affected by the timing of reported defaults.
During 2007 the United States housing market experienced a significant amount of home price depreciation, which had a direct negative impact on our loss reserves and paid claims during 2007. If home prices continue to decline on a more significant and larger geographic basis than experienced in 2007, we may incur a higher level of losses from paid claims and also be required to increase our loss reserves.
Because a significant portion of our business is sensitive to interest rates, a large increase in rates would cause higher monthly mortgage payments for borrowers that could potentially lead to a greater number of defaults, which would adversely impact our business.
Geographic concentration of our risk in force in certain distressed markets has resulted in increased defaults and higher risk in default from the significantly larger loans in these states. Ongoing house price depreciation in these distressed markets could lead to further increases in reserves and paid claims ,which could further significantly impact negatively our financial performance.
We experienced a significant increase in reported defaults and paid claims during 2007. If the pace of declining home prices and ongoing credit problems in the mortgage marketplace continues or remains unsettled, we anticipate an increased number of defaults and paid claims, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.
If the facts and estimates underlying the assumptions that we utilized at December 31, 2007, to determine both if a premium deficiency reserve is necessary or to ensure that the DAC is recoverable against future
profits change, we will need to adjust those assumptions in the future, which could result in the impairment of part or all of the DAC asset and require the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve, which would have a significant immediate adverse impact on results of operations.
If we have an extended period of low mortgage interest rates, it could lead to increased refinancings that would have a negative impact on persistency, which could lead to reduced insurance in force and ultimately to reduced revenues.
The premiums we charge for mortgage insurance on non-prime loans, pay option ARMs and Alt-A loans may not be adequate to compensate for future losses from these products, especially under distressed conditions.
A growing portion of our insurance in force consists of loans with high loan-to-value ratios, which could result in a greater number of defaults and larger claims than loans with lower loan-to-value ratios during periods of declining home prices.
Although we were successful in reducing our concentrations during 2007, our business remains concentrated among relatively few major lenders and our operating results could decline if we lose a significant customer.
Our revenues and profits could decline if we lose market share as a result of industry competition or if our competitive position suffers as a result of our inability to introduce and successfully market new products and programs.
Because we generally cannot cancel mortgage insurance policies or adjust renewal premiums due to changing economic conditions, unanticipated defaults and claims could cause our financial performance to suffer significantly.
Our loss experience is likely to increase as our policies continue to age.
Our revenues and DAC amortization depend on the renewal of policies that may terminate or fail to renew with Triad.
Our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims.
If we fail to properly underwrite mortgage loans when we provide contract underwriting services, we may be required to provide monetary and other remedies to the customer.
If the operating subsidiary, Triad, is prohibited from making interest payments on its $25 million surplus note to the holding company, then the holding company could be unable to make the required interest payments on its $35 million long-term debt outstanding.
If many of our lender partners for which we have entered into risk-sharing agreements, such as captive reinsurance treaties, continue under financial stress for an extended period of time, then the ability of these lenders to meet their financial obligations under the captive reinsurance treaties may be limited to the trust balances maintained within the reinsurance structures, which could have an adverse impact on future results of operations.
If we are unsuccessful in our litigation with a bankrupt former lender over our ability to rescind or deny coverage for certain loans due to program violations or fraud, this could have an adverse impact on future results of operations.
If the financial strength ratings of the financial guarantors that enhance a significant portion of our investment portfolio are lowered, that could limit the ability to sell affected bonds and could be indicative of a permanent impairment, which could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations.
If the lenders are unwilling or unable to continue our relationship going forward due to recent guideline changes and limitations imposed by us during the fourth quarter of 2007, then our future production could suffer and it could have a negative impact on future revenue and results of operations.
If we cannot reduce operating costs to meet the anticipated reduced production and in force amounts, then we may be unable to compete effectively with other mortgage insurers.
Loan servicers have recently experienced a significant increase in their workload due to the rapid growth in defaults and foreclosures. If the loan servicer fails to act proactively with delinquent borrowers in an effort to avoid foreclosure, then the number of delinquent loans eventually going to claim status could increase.
