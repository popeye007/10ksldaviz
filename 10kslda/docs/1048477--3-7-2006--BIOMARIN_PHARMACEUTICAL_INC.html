                    If we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than anticipated, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or discontinue operations.
If we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected and we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs.
If we fail to maintain regulatory approval to commercially market or sell our drugs, or if approval is delayed, we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.
To obtain regulatory approval to market our products, preclinical studies and costly and lengthy preclinical and clinical trials are required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain.
The fast-track designation for our product candidates, if obtained, may not actually lead to a faster review process and a delay in the review process or in the approval of our products will delay revenue from the sale of the products and will increase the capital necessary to fund these programs.
If we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.
If we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for some of our products, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions and our revenues will be reduced.
Because the target patient populations for some of our products are small, we must achieve significant market share and obtain high per-patient prices for our products to achieve profitability.
If we are found in violation of federal or state fraud and abuse laws, we may be required to pay a penalty or be suspended from participation in federal or state health care programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.
If we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our drug products by third-party payers, the sales of our drugs would be adversely affected or there may be no commercially viable markets for our products.
In the future, government price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, we may not be able to compete as effectively.
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued three patents to a third-party that relate to alpha-L-iduronidase. If we are not able to successfully challenge these patents, we may be prevented from producing Aldurazyme in the U.S. unless and until we obtain a license.
If our joint venture with Genzyme were terminated, we could be barred from commercializing Aldurazyme or our ability to successfully commercialize Aldurazyme would be delayed or diminished.
If our license agreement with Ascent Pediatrics is terminated or becomes non-exclusive we could be barred from commercializing Orapred or our ability to successfully commercialize Orapred could be diminished.
Our strategic alliance with Serono may be terminated at any time by Serono, and if it is terminated, our expenses could increase and our operating performance could be adversely affected.
If the option under the securities purchase agreement with Medicis to purchase all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Ascent Pediatrics is accelerated by Medicis, we may not have sufficient funds to exercise the option, which could result in a termination of the license agreement and our revenue could decrease significantly.
If we are unable to successfully develop manufacturing processes for our drug products to produce sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue, have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program.
If our manufacturing processes have a higher than expected failure rate, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue, have reduced margins, or be forced to terminate a program.
Our sole manufacturing facility for Aldurazyme and Naglazyme is located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facility and equipment, or that of our third-party manufacturers or single-source suppliers, which could materially impair our ability to manufacture Aldurazyme and Naglazyme or our third-party manufacturer s ability to manufacture Orapred or Phenoptin.
Supply interruptions may disrupt our inventory levels and the availability of our products and cause delays in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, or cause a loss of our market share and reduce our revenues.
Fluctuations in demand for our products create inventory maintenance uncertainties.
Our recent reduction in our sales force could adversely affect our ability to market our current and future products and could adversely affect our revenues.
If we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be adversely affected.
If we fail to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint venture and other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products and to continue to expand our product pipeline.
If we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.
We have no experience commercializing drug products in the E.U. and, if we are unable to successfully market and sell Naglazyme in the E.U., our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected.
We depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract, train and retain employees.
Our success depends on our ability to manage our growth.
Changes in methods of treatment of disease could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect revenues.
If product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.
We will incur increased costs as a result of recently enacted and proposed changes in laws and regulations.
Our stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.
Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, our stockholders rights plan and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.
