                    We may not succeed in promoting, strengthening and continuing to establish the Vistaprint brand, which would prevent us from acquiring new customers and increasing revenues.
Our quarterly financial results will often fluctuate, which may lead to volatility in our share price.
Seasonal fluctuations in our business place a strain on our operations and resources.
A significant portion of our revenues and operations are transacted in currencies other than the United States dollar, our reporting currency. We therefore have currency exchange risk.
We are dependent upon our own facilities for the production of our products, and any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities or any inability to increase capacity at these facilities would have an adverse impact on our business.
Interruptions to our website operations, information technology systems, production processes or customer service operations for any reason could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations.
Our failure to meet our customers price expectations would adversely affect our business and results of operations.
We depend on search engines to attract a substantial portion of the customers who visit our websites, and losing these customers would adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Various private spam blacklisting and similar entities have in the past, and may in the future, interfere with our e-mail solicitation, the operation of our websites and our ability to conduct business.
We may not succeed in cross selling additional products and services to our customers.
If we are unable to retain security authentication certificates, which are supplied by third party providers over which we exercise little or no control, our business could be harmed.
Our customers create products that incorporate images, illustrations and fonts that we license from third parties, and any loss of the right to use these licensed materials may substantially harm our business and results of operations.
If we are unable to market and sell products and services beyond our existing target markets and develop new products and services to attract new customers, our results of operations may suffer.
The loss of key personnel or an inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.
If we are unable to manage our expected growth and expand our operations successfully, our reputation would be damaged and our business and results of operations would be harmed.
If we are unable to manage the challenges associated with our international operations, the growth of our business could be negatively impacted.
Acquisitions may be disruptive to our business.
Our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted by general economic and financial market conditions, and such conditions may increase the other risks that affect our business.
The United States government may substantially increase border controls and impose duties or restrictions on cross-border commerce that may substantially harm our business.
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which may impede our ability to build brand identity, cause confusion among our customers, damage our reputation and permit others to practice our patented technology, which could substantially harm our business and results of operations.
Intellectual property disputes and litigation are costly and could cause us to lose our exclusive rights or be subject to liability or require us to stop some of our business activities.
We sell our products and services primarily through our websites. If we are unable to acquire or maintain domain names for our websites, then we could lose customers, which would substantially harm our business and results of operations.
Our revenues may be negatively affected if we are required to charge sales, value added or other taxes on internet sales.
Our business is dependent on the Internet, and unfavorable changes in government regulation of the Internet, e-commerce and email marketing could substantially harm our business and results of operations.
If we were required to review the content that our customers incorporate into our products and interdict the shipment of products that violate copyright protections or other laws, our costs would significantly increase, which would harm our results of operations.
We expect that revenues we derive from third party referral programs will decrease in the future due to our termination of membership discount program offerings, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Purported Federal class action lawsuits have been filed alleging that certain of our customers were, without their knowledge or consent, enrolled in and billed for membership discount programs previously offered by third party merchants on our Vistaprint.com website. If we or the third party merchants are unable to successfully resolve these lawsuits or similar claims that may be brought in the future, our reputation, revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our practice of offering free products and services could be subject to judicial or regulatory challenge, which, if successful, would hinder our ability to attract customers and generate revenue.
Our failure to protect our network and the confidential information of our customers against security breaches and to address risks associated with credit card fraud could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations.
We are subject to customer payment-related risks.
We may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell.
Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure
Challenges by various tax authorities to our complex international structure could, if successful, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our earnings.
Our intercompany arrangements may be challenged, resulting in higher taxes or penalties and an adverse effect on our earnings.
We will pay taxes even if we are not profitable on a consolidated basis, which would cause increased losses and further harm to our results of operations.
Provisions of our Articles of Association, the Articles of Association of the independent foundation, Stichting Continu teit Vistaprint, Dutch law and the call option we granted to the independent foundation may make it difficult to replace or remove management and may inhibit or delay a change of control, including a takeover attempt that might result in a premium over the market price for our ordinary shares, and dilute your voting power.
We have limited flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management.
Because of our Articles of Association and our organization under Dutch law, you may find it difficult to pursue legal remedies against the members of our supervisory board or management board.
We are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and the vast majority of our assets are located outside the United States, which may make it difficult for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.
We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to Dutch withholding tax.
