                    Risks Inherent in Our Business
We depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a substantial majority of our revenue. A substantial reduction of revenue from one or more of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The obligations of several of our key customers under their terminaling services agreements may be reduced or suspended in some circumstances, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
If one or more of our current terminaling services agreements is terminated or expires and we are unable to secure comparable alternative arrangements, our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.
Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.
In the event we are required to refinance our existing debt in unfavorable market conditions, we may have to pay higher interest rates and be subject to more stringent financial covenants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and may impair our ability to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders.
Our continued working capital requirements, distributions to unitholders and expansion programs may require access to additional capital. Tightened credit markets or more expensive capital could impair our ability to maintain or grow our operations, or to fund distributions to our unitholders.
If we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, any future growth will be limited.
Any acquisitions we make are subject to substantial risks, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Competition from other terminals and pipelines that are able to supply our customers with storage capacity at a lower price could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
We are exposed to the credit risks of Morgan Stanley Capital Group and TransMontaigne Inc. and our other significant customers, which could affect our creditworthiness. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by such customers could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
A significant decrease in demand for refined products due to price volatility or adverse economic conditions may cause one or more of our significant customers to reduce their use of our tank capacity and throughput volumes at our terminal facilities, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Because of recent, unprecedented contraction in global financial and credit markets, one or more of our significant customers may become unable to secure financing arrangements adequate to purchase their desired volume of product, which could reduce use of our tank capacity and throughput volumes at our terminal facilities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our business involves many hazards and operational risks, including adverse weather conditions, which could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and increased operating costs.
Expanding our business by constructing new facilities subjects us to risks that the project may not be completed on schedule and that the costs associated with the project may exceed our estimates or budgeted costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Because of our lack of asset diversification, adverse developments in our terminals or pipeline operations could adversely affect our revenue and cash flows.
Our operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.
Terrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks, have resulted in increased costs to our business. Continued hostilities in the Middle East or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.
We are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business, and could incur substantial liabilities as a result.
Many of our storage tanks and portions of our pipeline system have been in service for several decades that could result in increased maintenance or remediation expenditures, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to pay cash distributions.
Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us
We may not have sufficient cash from operations to enable us to maintain or grow the distribution to our unitholders following establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to our general partner.
TransMontaigne Inc. controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. TransMontaigne Inc. and Morgan Stanley Capital Group have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary duties, which may permit them to favor their own interests to our detriment.
Cost reimbursements, which will be determined by our general partner, and fees due our general partner and its affiliates for services provided are and will continue to be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders.
The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.
Our general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.
Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by states. If the Internal Revenue Service were to treat us as a corporation or if we were to become subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced.
If the Internal Revenue Service were to successfully challenge our use of a calendar year end for federal income tax purposes, the challenge may result in adjustments to the federal income tax liability of our unitholders, and the imposition of tax penalties on us, and we may have difficulty providing our unitholders with all of the information necessary to timely file their federal income tax returns. As a result, the market for our common units may be adversely affected and our relations with our unitholders could suffer.
If the sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit interests occurs within a 12-month period, we would experience a deemed termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.
We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.
A unitholder whose units are loaned to a "short seller" to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.
