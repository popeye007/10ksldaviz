                    Risks Related To Our Business and Our Industry
Redpoint is a development-stage company. We have incurred losses since inception and expect to incur additional net losses for at least the next several years.
We will need substantial additional funding to develop our products and for our future operations. If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to do so, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate our product development or may be unable to continue our business.
We are an early stage company and currently have no products available for sale, license or use. Our product candidates require additional research, development, testing, expert reviews and/or and regulatory approvals before marketing. We may be unable to develop, obtain regulatory approval or market any of our product candidates. If our product candidates are delayed or fail, our financial condition will be negatively affected, and we may have to curtail or cease our operations.
We may not successfully establish and maintain collaborative and licensing arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.
If we or our collaborators are unable to obtain and maintain the GRAS determination or regulatory approval required before any taste enhancers or aversive taste blockers can be incorporated into products that are sold, we would be unable to commercialize our taste enhancers and aversive taste blockers and our business would be adversely affected.
Even if we or our collaborators receive a GRAS determination or regulatory approval and incorporate our taste enhancers or aversive taste blockers into products, those products may never be commercially successful.
We may experience delays in clinical trials and regulatory approval relating to our products that could adversely affect our financial results and our commercial prospects for our pharmaceutical products.
If our pharmaceutical product candidates, including any product candidates we may develop under our early stage diabetes program, do not successfully complete the clinical trial process, we will not be able to market them. Even successful clinical trials may not result in a marketable product and may not be entirely indicative of a product's safety or efficacy.
Because we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our pharmaceutical product candidates, we cannot predict the timing of any future revenue from these product candidates.
We will rely on third parties to manufacture taste enhancers, aversive taste blockers and pharmaceutical product candidates. There can be no guarantee that we can obtain sufficient and acceptable quantities of our taste enhancers or aversive taste blockers or pharmaceutical product candidates on acceptable terms, which may delay or impair our ability to develop, test and market such products.
If we do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the manufacture and distribution of our product candidates, we may incur penalties that may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and adversely affect our revenue.
If we are unable to create and maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform those functions, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates.
Many potential competitors, including those who have greater resources and experience than we do, may develop products or technologies that make ours obsolete or noncompetitive.
If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and advisors, it may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing, pursue collaborations or develop our product candidates.
We use hazardous and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.
We may be sued for product liability, which could adversely affect our business.
Risks Related To Intellectual Property
If our product candidates are not effectively protected by valid, issued patents or if we are not otherwise able to protect our proprietary information and technologies, it could harm our business.
We may not have adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary information, which could adversely affect our competitive position.
Our ability to compete in the ingredient, food and beverage market and the pharmaceutical market may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary technologies.
Many of the patent applications we and our licensors have filed have not yet been substantively examined and may not result in patents being issued.
Disputes concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and extremely costly and could delay our research and development efforts.
Risks Related to Our Fluctuating Operating Results, Possible Acquisitions and Management of Growth
We expect that our results of operations will fluctuate from period to period, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline, causing investor losses.
If we acquire products, technologies or other businesses, we will incur a variety of costs, may have integration difficulties and may experience numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business.
To the extent we enter markets outside of the United States, our business will be subject to political, economic, legal and social risks in those markets, which could adversely affect our business.
We may encounter difficulties managing our growth, which could adversely affect our business.
An economic downturn and adverse economic conditions may harm our business.
Risks Related to our Common Stock; Liquidity Risks
The sale of a significant number of our shares of common stock in the public market could depress the market price of common stock.
The price of our common stock is expected to continue to be volatile.
We do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Because Redpoint became a public company as a result of the Reverse Merger and Reincorporation Merger and not through a traditional underwritten initial public offering of securities, the Company may not attract the attention of major brokerage firms. Additionally, as a public company, we incur substantial expenses.
We have discretion on how we use any proceeds we receive from the exercise of warrants and options.
It is not anticipated that there will be an active public market for shares of our common stock in the near term and stockholders may have to hold their shares of common stock for an indefinite period of time. Stockholders may be unable to resell a large number of their shares of common stock within a short time frame or at or above their purchase price.
If we do not comply with registration rights granted to certain holders of our restricted securities, we may be required to pay damages to such holders.
Our common stock may be considered "a penny stock" and may be difficult to sell.
Substantial future issuances of our common stock could depress our stock price.
Our stockholders may experience additional dilution upon the exercise of warrants or options.
Directors and officers of the Company have a high concentration of our common stock ownership.
