                    WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND EXPECT LOSSES TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS AND WITHOUT IT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS.
A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES ARE ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARE PURCHASE OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES AND WE HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES TO ISSUE IN CONNECTION WITH NEW EQUITY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO INCREASE OUR AUTHORIZED CAPITAL, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE SUFFICIENT WORKING CAPITAL.
WE MAY FAIL TO OBTAIN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TO DEVELOP OUR HEMOPURIFIER(R) TECHNOLOGY FOR BIODEFENSE APPLICATIONS.
WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS.
WE WILL FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, PERSONNEL AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES THAN OURS. THESE COMPETITIVE FORCES MAY IMPACT OUR PROJECTED GROWTH AND ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES AND PROFITS, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT.
WE HAVE LIMITED MANUFACTURING EXPERIENCE.
OUR HEMOPURIFIER(R) TECHNOLOGY MAY BECOME OBSOLETE.
OUR USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, CHEMICALS AND VIRUSES REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPOSES US TO POTENTIAL LIABILITIES.
WE ARE DEPENDENT FOR OUR SUCCESS ON A FEW KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. OUR INABILITY TO RETAIN THOSE OFFICERS WOULD IMPEDE OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND GROWTH STRATEGIES, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT.
OUR INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL COULD IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES AND PROFITS AND TO OTHERWISE IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND GROWTH STRATEGIES, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT.
WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT.
WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING MANAGEMENT AND OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS A RESULT OF THEIR CONCERNS RELATING TO THEIR INCREASED PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO LAWSUITS AND SHAREHOLDER CLAIMS BY VIRTUE OF HOLDING THESE POSITIONS IN A PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY.
IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH EXTENSIVE REGULATIONS OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES COULD BE PREVENTED OR DELAYED.
DELAYS IN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING OUR CLINICAL TRIALS COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL OR MARKET OUR HEMOPURIFIER(R) PRODUCT CANDIDATES ON A TIMELY BASIS.
IN THE CONDUCT OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS.
THE APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICAL PRODUCTS USED TO FIGHT BIOTERRORISM ARE STILL EVOLVING, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ANY PRODUCTS WE DEVELOP, IF EFFECTIVE, WOULD MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS.
OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT YIELD MARKETABLE PRODUCTS DUE TO RESULTS OF STUDIES OR TRIALS, FAILURE TO ACHIEVE REGULATORY APPROVALS OR MARKET ACCEPTANCE, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS OR MANUFACTURING ISSUES.
THE PATENTS WE OWN COMPRISE A MAJORITY OF OUR ASSETS WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR FINANCIAL VIABILITY.
LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS AND POTENTIAL NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO IMPACT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO RECALL OR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS.
POLITICAL OR SOCIAL FACTORS MAY DELAY OR IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.
TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT PAID ANY CASH DIVIDENDS AND NO CASH DIVIDENDS WILL BE PAID IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
THE APPLICATION OF THE "PENNY STOCK" RULES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES AND INCREASE YOUR TRANSACTION COSTS TO SELL THOSE SHARES.
OUR COMMON SHARES ARE THINLY TRADED, SO YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL AT OR NEAR ASK PRICES OR AT ALL IF YOU NEED TO SELL YOUR SHARES TO RAISE MONEY OR OTHERWISE DESIRE TO LIQUIDATE YOUR SHARES.
THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON SHARES IS PARTICULARLY VOLATILE GIVEN OUR STATUS AS A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN COMPANY WITH A SMALL AND THINLY-TRADED PUBLIC FLOAT, LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND LACK OF REVENUE WHICH COULD LEAD TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR SHARE PRICE. THE PRICE AT WHICH YOU PURCHASE OUR COMMON SHARES MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE PRICE THAT WILL PREVAIL IN THE TRADING MARKET. YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL YOUR COMMON SHARES AT OR ABOVE YOUR PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES TO YOU.
VOLATILITY IN OUR COMMON SHARE PRICE MAY SUBJECT US TO SECURITIES LITIGATION.
OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS BENEFICIALLY OWN OR CONTROL APPROXIMATELY 21.5% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES AS OF MARCH 31, 2009, WHICH MAY LIMIT YOUR ABILITY OR THAT OF OTHER SHAREHOLDERS, WHETHER ACTING INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, TO PROPOSE OR DIRECT THE MANAGEMENT OR OVERALL DIRECTION OF OUR COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, THIS CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP COULD DISCOURAGE OR PREVENT A POTENTIAL TAKEOVER OF OUR COMPANY THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE RESULT IN YOU RECEIVING A PREMIUM OVER THE MARKET PRICE FOR YOUR COMMON SHARES.
A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES ARE ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARE PURCHASE OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES. THE EXERCISE OR CONVERSION OF THESE SECURITIES COULD RESULT IN THE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF YOUR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP IN THE COMPANY AS WELL AS THE BOOK VALUE OF YOUR COMMON SHARES. THE SALE OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF COMMON SHARES RECEIVED UPON EXERCISE OF THESE OPTIONS OR WARRANTS ON THE PUBLIC MARKET TO FINANCE THE EXERCISE PRICE OR TO PAY ASSOCIATED INCOME TAXES, OR THE PERCEPTION THAT SUCH SALES COULD OCCUR, COULD SUBSTANTIALLY DEPRESS THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICES FOR OUR SHARES.
OUR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES, OR OPTIONS OR WARRANTS TO PURCHASE THOSE SHARES, WOULD DILUTE YOUR PROPORTIONATE OWNERSHIP AND VOTING RIGHTS.
OUR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR SERVICES OR TO REPAY DEBT, WOULD DILUTE YOUR PROPORTIONATE OWNERSHIP AND VOTING RIGHTS AND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.
THE ELIMINATION OF MONETARY LIABILITY AGAINST OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES UNDER OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND THE EXISTENCE OF INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS TO OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES BY OUR COMPANY AND MAY DISCOURAGE LAWSUITS AGAINST OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.
ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS MAY IMPEDE THE ACQUISITION OF OUR COMPANY.
