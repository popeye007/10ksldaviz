                    Risks Relating to Our Business Information Division
We depend on the economies and the demographics of our targeted sectors in the local and regional markets that we serve, and changes in those factors could have an adverse impact on our revenues, cash flows and profitability.
A change in the laws governing public notice requirements, as well as new or increased regulation of residential mortgage products, may delay, reduce or eliminate the amount of public notices required to be published in print, affect how newspapers are chosen for the publication of public notices or adversely change the eligibility requirements for publishing public notices, which could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and growth opportunities.
If we are unable to compete effectively with other companies in the media industry, our revenues and profitability may decline.
If our Business Information operations in certain states where we generate a significant portion of that operating division s revenues are not as successful in the future, our operating results could be adversely affected.
A key component of our operating income and operating cash flows has been, and may continue to be, our minority equity investment in a Michigan publishing company.
Government regulations related to the Internet could increase our cost of doing business, affect our ability to grow or may otherwise negatively affect our business.
If we are unable to generate traffic to our online publications and other web sites and electronic services, our ability to continue to grow our Business Information Division may be negatively affected.
Risks Relating to Our Professional Services Division
We have owned and operated the businesses with our Professional Services Division for only a short period of time.
David A. Trott, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of APC, and certain other employees of APC or NDEx, who are also shareholders and principal attorneys of our law firm customers, may under certain circumstances have interests that differ from or conflict with our interests.
If the number of case files referred to us by our six current mortgage default processing service law firm customers decreases or fails to increase, our operating results and ability to execute our growth strategy could be adversely affected.
Regulation of the legal profession may constrain APC s and Counsel Press operations, and numerous issues arising out of that regulation, its interpretation or evolution could impair our ability to provide professional services to our customer and reduce our revenues and profitability.
Regulation of sub-prime, Alt-A and other residential mortgage products, including bills introduced in states where we do business, the Hope for Homeowners Act, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, and voluntary foreclosure relief programs developed by lenders, loan servicers and the Hope Now Alliance, a consortium that includes loan servicers, may have an adverse effect on or restrict our mortgage default processing services and public notice operations.
Failure to effectively customize either of our proprietary case management software systems so that they can be used to serve law firm customers in new states could adversely affect our mortgage default processing service business and growth prospects.
Claims, even if not valid, that our case management software systems, document conversion system or other proprietary software products and information systems infringe on the intellectual property rights of others could increase our expenses or inhibit us from offering certain services.
Changes in court practices or procedures may affect the filing and service requirements for appellate case filing or may reduce or eliminate the amount of appellate case filings, either of which could adversely affect Counsel Press s revenues, profitability and growth opportunities or adversely restrict its operations.
Risks Relating to Our Business in General
We depend on key personnel and we may not be able to operate and grow our business effectively if we lose the services of any of our key personnel or are unable to attract qualified personnel in the future.
We intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities, which we may not do successfully and may subject us to considerable business and financial risks.
We may have difficulty managing our growth, which may result in operating inefficiencies and negatively impact our operating margins.
We rely on our proprietary case management software systems, document conversion systems, web sites and online networks, and a disruption, failure or security compromise of these systems may disrupt our business, damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
We may be required to incur additional indebtedness or raise additional capital to fund our operations and acquisitions, repay our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures and this additional cash may not be available to us on satisfactory timing or terms or at all.
Our business and reputation could suffer if third-party providers of printing and delivery services and technology and system support that we rely upon as well as newspapers, including those of The Detroit Legal News Publishing, where we place foreclosure public notices fail to perform satisfactorily.
We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time and resources to various compliance issues; if we do not address these compliance issues successfully, our stock price could be adversely impacted.
If our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets becomes impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
We have incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, net losses.
We are subject to risks relating to litigation due to the nature of our product and service offerings.
Our failure to comply with the covenants contained on our debt instruments could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business as planned.
We may be required to incur additional indebtedness if any of the minority members of APC exercises its put right with respect to its membership interest in APC.
We rely on exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property that may not be adequately protected under current laws, and we encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties.
Risks Associated with Purchasing Our Common Stock
Our common stock has a limited trading history and, during that time, the market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. The market price of our common stock depends on a variety of factors, which could cause our common stock to trade at prices below the price you have paid.
Future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or your rights as holders of our common stock.
Future sales of our common stock in the public market may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or our ability to raise additional capital.
