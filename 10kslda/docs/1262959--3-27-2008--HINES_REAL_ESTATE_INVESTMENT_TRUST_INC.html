                    There is currently no public market for our common shares, and we do not intend to list the shares on a stock exchange. Therefore, it will likely be difficult for shareholders to sell their shares and, if they are able to sell their shares, they will likely sell them at a substantial discount. The price of our common shares may be adjusted to a price less than the price shareholders paid for their shares.
Our shareholders ability to have their shares redeemed is limited under our share redemption program, and if shareholders are able to have their shares redeemed, it may be at a price that is less than the price paid for and the then-current market value of the shares.
Due to the risks involved in the ownership of real estate, there is no guarantee of any return on an investment in our shares, and shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.
We have invested a significant percentage of our total current investments, and we may make additional investments, in the Core Fund. Because of our current and possible future Core Fund investments, it is likely that Hines affiliates will retain significant control over a significant percentage of our investments even if our independent directors remove our Advisor.
Many of the fees we pay were not determined on an arm s-length basis and therefore may not be on the same terms we could achieve from a third party.
We will pay substantial compensation to Hines, the Advisor and their affiliates, which may be increased or decreased during the Current Offering or future offerings by our independent directors.
If we are only able to sell a small number of shares in our Current Offering, our fixed operating expenses such as general and administrative expenses (as a percentage of gross income) would be higher than if we are able to sell a greater number of shares.
Hines REIT s interest in the Operating Partnership will be diluted by the Participation Interest in the Operating Partnership held by HALP Associates Limited Partnership and an interest in Hines REIT may be diluted if we issue additional shares.
The redemption of interests in the Operating Partnership held by Hines and its affiliates (including the Participation Interest) as required by our Advisory Agreement upon its termination may discourage a takeover attempt if the takeover attempt would include the termination of our Advisory Agreement.
The Participation Interest would increase at a faster rate with frequent dispositions of properties followed by acquisitions using proceeds from such dispositions.
Hines ability to cause the Operating Partnership to purchase the Participation Interest and any OP Units it and its affiliates hold in connection with the termination of the Advisory Agreement may deter us from terminating the Advisory Agreement.
We may issue preferred shares or separate classes or series of common shares, which issuance could adversely affect the holders of our common shares.
We are not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and therefore we will not be subject to the requirements imposed on an investment company by such Act. Similarly, the Core Fund is not registered as an investment company.
If Hines REIT, the Operating Partnership or the Core Fund is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, the additional expenses and operational limitations associated with such registration may reduce our shareholders investment return or impair our ability to conduct our business as planned.
The ownership limit in our charter may discourage a takeover attempt.
We will not be afforded the protection of the Maryland General Corporation Law relating to business combinations.
Business and Real Estate Risks
We are different in some respects from other programs sponsored by Hines, and therefore the past performance of such programs may not be indicative of our future results.
Geographic and industry concentration of our portfolio may make us particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in those areas and sectors.
Delays in purchasing properties with proceeds received from our Current Offering may result in a lower rate of return to investors.
If we purchase assets at a time when the commercial real estate market is experiencing substantial influxes of capital investment and competition for properties, the real estate we purchase may not appreciate or may decrease in value.
We may need to incur borrowings that would otherwise not be incurred to meet REIT minimum distribution requirements.
We expect to acquire additional properties in the future, which, if unsuccessful, could adversely impact our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders.
We are subject to risks as the result of joint ownership of real estate with other Hines programs and third parties.
Our ability to redeem all or a portion of our investment in the Core Fund is subject to significant restrictions.
If the Core Fund is forced to sell its assets in order to satisfy mandatory redemption requirements, our investment in the Core Fund may be materially adversely affected.
If we invest in a limited partnership as a general partner, we could be responsible for all liabilities of such partnership.
Because of our inability to retain earnings, we will rely on debt and equity financings for acquisitions. If we do not have sufficient capital resources from such financings, our growth may be limited.
Our use of borrowings to partially fund acquisitions and improvements on properties could result in foreclosures and unexpected debt service expenses upon refinancing, both of which could have an adverse impact on our operations and cash flow.
We have acquired and may acquire various financial instruments for purposes of hedging or reducing our risks, which may be costly and ineffective and could reduce our cash available for distribution to our shareholders.
Our success will be dependent on the performance of Hines as well as key employees of Hines.
We operate in a competitive business, and many of our competitors have significant resources and operating flexibility, allowing them to compete effectively with us.
We depend on tenants for our revenue, and therefore our revenue is dependent on the success and economic viability of our tenants. Our reliance on single or significant tenants in certain buildings may decrease our ability to lease vacated space.
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely impact our operations and our ability to pay distributions.
Unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact occupancy or rental rates
Uninsured losses relating to real property may adversely impact the value of our portfolio.
We may be unable to obtain desirable types of insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, if at all, and we may be unable to comply with insurance requirements contained in mortgage or other agreements due to high insurance costs.
Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate, our operations and our profitability.
Our operations will be directly affected by general economic and regulatory factors we cannot control or predict.
Volatility in debt markets could impact future acquisitions and values of real estate assets potentially reducing cash available for distribution to our shareholders.
We may have difficulty selling real estate investments, and our ability to distribute all or a portion of the net proceeds from such sale to our shareholders may be limited.
Potential liability as the result of, and the cost of compliance with, environmental matters could adversely affect our operations.
All of our properties will be subject to property taxes that may increase in the future, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
Our costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect cash available for distributions.
If we set aside insufficient working capital reserves, we may be required to defer necessary or desirable property improvements.
We are subject to additional risks from our international investments.
Investments in properties outside the United States may subject us to foreign currency risks, which may adversely affect distributions and our REIT status.
Retail properties depend on anchor tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of a key anchor tenant.
If we make or invest in loans, our loans may be impacted by unfavorable real estate market conditions, which could decrease the value of our loan investments.
If we make or invest in loans, our loans will be subject to interest rate fluctuations, which could reduce our returns as compared to market interest rates as well as the value of the mortgage loans in the event we sell the loans.
Delays in liquidating defaulted loans could reduce our investment returns.
We may make or invest in mezzanine loans, which involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by real properties.
Our investment policies may change without shareholder approval, which could not only alter the nature of your investment but also subject your investment to new and additional risks.
Potential Conflicts of Interest Risks
We compete with affiliates of Hines for real estate investment opportunities. Some of these affiliates have preferential rights to accept or reject certain investment opportunities in advance of our right to accept or reject such opportunities. Many of the preferential rights we have to accept or reject investment opportunities are subordinate to the preferential rights of at least one affiliate of Hines.
We may compete with other entities affiliated with Hines for tenants.
Employees of the Advisor and Hines will face conflicts of interest relating to time management and allocation of resources and investment opportunities.
Hines may face conflicts of interest if it sells properties it acquires or develops to us.
Hines may face a conflict of interest when determining whether we should dispose of any property we own that is managed by Hines because Hines may lose fees associated with the management of the property.
Hines may face conflicts of interest in connection with the management of our day-to-day operations and in the enforcement of agreements between Hines and its affiliates.
Certain of our officers and directors face conflicts of interest relating to the positions they hold with other entities.
Our officers and directors have limited liability.
Our UPREIT structure may result in potential conflicts of interest.
If we fail to qualify as a REIT, our operations and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders would be adversely impacted.
If the Operating Partnership is classified as a publicly traded partnership under the Code, our operations and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected.
Distributions to tax-exempt investors may be classified as unrelated business taxable income.
Investors may realize taxable income without receiving cash distributions.
Foreign investors may be subject to FIRPTA tax on sale of common shares if we are unable to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT.
