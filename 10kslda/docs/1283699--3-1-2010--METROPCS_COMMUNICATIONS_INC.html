                    Risks Related to Our Business
Our business strategy may not succeed in the long term.
Our tax inclusive plans make us susceptible to increases in taxes and regulatory fees.
The lack of a strong brand name or inability to maintain or strengthen our brands may reduce our ability to retain and attract customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
A failure to meet the demands of our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
We may not be successful in continuing to grow our customer base.
Our business is seasonal and our operating results for future periods will be affected negatively if we fail to have strong customer growth in the first and fourth quarters.
Failing to manage our churn rate or experiencing a higher rate of customer turnover than we have forecasted could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
Our operations require continued capital expenditures and a failure to access additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
We face intense competition from other telecommunications providers and new entrants in the marketplace.
We may face additional competition from existing or new entrants as a result of future FCC auctions of spectrum and/or through legislative change or actions by the FCC allowing the development of new products and services by existing competitors and allowing other non-telecommunications businesses to enter the industry.
The continuing consolidation in the wireless industry through mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures is creating increased competition and marketing initiatives.
We may face increasing competitive pricing and service bundling, which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and the profitability of our services.
We may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to new marketing and sales initiatives launched by our competitors.
We may not have a large enough supply of handsets to meet the demands of our customers.
The wireless industry is experiencing rapid technological change.
We are dependent on certain network technology improvements, which may not occur or may be materially delayed.
We may be unable to expand our LTE services beyond our existing service area to meet customer expectations.
We may be unable to successfully develop and incorporate wireless data services profitably into our service offerings in the future.
We may be unable to acquire additional spectrum in the future at a reasonable cost.
We may undertake mergers, acquisitions or strategic transactions that could result in operating difficulties, dilution and distraction from our business.
Business, political, regulatory and economic factors may significantly affect our operations, the manner in which we conduct our business and slow our rate of growth.
We are exposed to counterparty risk in our senior secured credit facility and related interest rate protection agreements.
The investment of our substantial cash balances are subject to risk.
We currently have an exclusive arrangement with our billing services vendor.
We may be unable to enforce or protect our intellectual property and intellectual property rights.
We and our suppliers may be subject to claims of infringement.
Substantially all of our CDMA network infrastructure equipment is manufactured or provided by a single infrastructure vendor.
Substantially all of our LTE infrastructure equipment and initial dual mode CDMA/LTE handsets are manufactured or provided by one vendor.
We rely on third parties to provide products, software and services that are integral to our business.
We rely heavily on indirect distribution channels.
We and our indirect dealers face direct competition with some of our other indirect distribution agents and dealers.
Our agreements with our indirect distribution agents may be terminated on relatively short notice.
We utilize a limited number of cell site and DAS providers.
We are increasingly focused on providing nationwide service, but we may be unable to obtain the roaming and other services we need from other carriers at rates that allow us to provide such nationwide service and still remain competitive.
Future regulatory changes may also affect our ability to enter into new or maintain existing roaming agreements on competitive terms.
We may incur higher than anticipated intercarrier compensation costs.
A portion of our third-party customer service and technical support providers and a portion of our revenue are derived from geographic areas susceptible to natural and other disasters.
Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.
Recent political changes could have an adverse effect on our relationship with our workforce.
We are subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments, and the applicability and the amount of these fees is subject to great uncertainty.
Concerns about whether wireless telephones pose health and safety risks may lead to the adoption of new regulations or lawsuits that could decrease demand for our services.
System failures, security breaches and the unauthorized use of or interference with our network could cause delays or interruptions of service, increase our cost of operations, and result in harm to our business reputation, which could cause us to lose customers.
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters
Our ability to provide service to our customers and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action.
We may be unable to obtain necessary governmental authorizations and permits on reasonable terms and conditions.
We are subject to significant federal and state regulation.
The structure of the transaction with Royal Street Communications creates risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
Royal Street owns certain licenses that we do not control and that may never be sold to us.
Spectrum for which we have been granted licenses as a result of AWS Auction 66 and Auction 73 is subject to certain legal challenges, which may ultimately result in the FCC revoking our licenses.
Our stock price has historically been, and may continue to be, volatile and you may lose all or some of your investment.
Your ownership interest could be diluted by future issuances of shares that our Board has the authority to issue, and such future issuances or sales of such shares may adversely affect the market price of MetroPCS common stock.
If we fail to manage our planned growth effectively and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.
The value of our FCC licenses may drop in the future as a result of volatility in the marketplace and the sale of additional spectrum by the FCC.
Declines in our operating performance could ultimately result in an impairment of our indefinite-lived assets, including FCC licenses, or our long-lived assets, including property and equipment.
Changes in interpretations of accounting requirements, changes in industry practice, the identification of errors or changes in management assumptions could require amendments to or restatements of financial information or disclosures included in this or prior filings with the SEC.
Even with our current levels of indebtedness, we may incur additional indebtedness.
To service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available to us.
Our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our
senior notes include restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility.
Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and our senior creditors would have a prior secured claim to any collateral securing the debt owed to them.
Settlements, judgments, restraints on our current or future manner of doing business or legal costs resulting from pending or future litigation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
We are currently controlled by a limited number of stockholders, and their interests may be different from yours.
Our stockholder rights plan could prevent a change in control of our Company in instances in which some stockholders may believe a change in control is in their best interests.
Conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our stockholders, and we have waived our rights to certain corporate opportunities.
Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware corporate law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
