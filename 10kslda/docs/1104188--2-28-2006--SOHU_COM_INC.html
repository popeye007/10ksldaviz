                    Risks Related to Our Business
We are a relatively young company subject to the risks associated with operating in a new and evolving market.
Our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may differ from market expectations.
We face intense competition which could reduce our market share and adversely affect our financial performance.
If we fail to successfully develop and introduce new products and services, our competitive position and ability to generate revenues could be harmed.
Our business depends on a strong brand, thus we will not be able to attract user, customers and clients of our products and offerings if we do not maintain and develop our brands.
Our failure to keep up with rapid technology changes may severely affect our future success.
We depend on online advertising for a significant portion of our revenues, but the online advertisement market includes many uncertainties, which could cause our advertising and revenues to decline.
The expansion of Internet advertisement blocking software may result in a decrease of advertising revenues.
Our failure to retain key distributors or attract additional distributors for our sponsored search customers could have an adverse impact on our business.
We rely on our Website Alliance members for a significant portion of our revenues. If we fail to retain existing Website Alliance members or attract additional members, our revenues and growth may be adversely affected.
We rely on wireless services for a significant portion of our revenues. Wireless revenues decreased in prior periods and may decrease further in the future.
We rely on contracts with the mobile network operators in a number of ways with respect to our wireless services, including billing of, and collection from, mobile phone users of wireless service fees. If our arrangements with mobile network operators were to be terminated, altered or not renewed, or if such operators did not provide continuous or adequate service, our revenues could be reduced.
Many of our current and potential wireless customers have only limited experience using the Internet for subscription purposes, and may not be willing to fully embrace the products and services we offer, which would adversely affect our future revenues and business expansion.
Our investment in online games and e-commerce may not be successful.
Our strategy of acquiring complementary assets, technologies and businesses may fail and result in equity or earnings dilution.
The acquisition and integration of 17173.com, Focus.cn, Goodfeel and Go2Map create certain risks and uncertainties.
We may be required to record a charge to earnings if we must reassess our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets arising from acquisitions.
Our failure to manage growth and diversify of our business could harm us.
If we fail to establish and maintain relationships with content and technology providers and mobile network operators, we may not be able to attract and retain users.
We depend on key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose the services of our key executives and employees.
Rapid growth and a rapidly changing operating environment strain our limited resources.
Risks Related to China s Telecommunications infrastructure
The telecommunications infrastructure in China, which is not as well developed as in the United States, may limit our growth.
We depend on ChinaNet, China Netcom and China Telecom for telecommunications services, and any interruption in these services may result in severe disruptions to our business.
The high cost of Internet access may limit the growth of the Internet in China and impede our growth.
To the extent we are unable to scale our systems to meet the increasing PRC Internet population, we will be unable to expand our user base and increase our attractiveness to advertisers and merchants.
Unexpected network interruptions caused by system failures may result in reduced visitor traffic, reduced revenue and harm to our reputation.
Our operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other events, as we only have limited backup systems and do not maintain any backup servers outside of China.
Our network operations may be vulnerable to hacking, viruses and other disruptions, which may make our products and services less attractive and reliable.
Risks Related to China s Regulation Environment
If our current ownership structure is found to be in violation of current or future PRC laws, rules or regulations regarding the legality of foreign investment in the PRC Internet sector, we could be subject to severe penalties.
We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by Sohu.com Limited, our wholly owned subsidiary, to fund any cash requirements we may have. We may not be able to obtain cash from distributions to the extent such distributions are restricted by PRC law or future debt covenants. For any dividend received by Sohu.com Inc., it would be subject to US tax at 34% to 35%.
We may be unable to collect long-term loans to officers and employees or exercise management influence associated with Beijing Sohu, High Century, Hengda, Goodfeel, Huohu and Sogou Information.
We depend upon contractual arrangements with Beijing Sohu, Hengda, High Century, Sohu Internet, Goodfeel, Huohu, Tu Xing Tian Xia, Feng Yang Tian Lang and Sogou Information for the success of our business and these arrangements may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership of these businesses and may be difficult to enforce.
If we are found to be in violation of current or future PRC laws, rules or regulations regarding Internet-related services and telecom-related activities, we could be subject to severe penalties.
We may not be able to collect payments of our wireless fees if the PRC government determines that our existing ownership structure does not comply with PRC laws, rules or regulations.
Even if we are in compliance with PRC governmental regulations relating to licensing and foreign investment prohibitions, the PRC government may prevent us from distributing, and we may be subject to liability for, content that it believes is inappropriate.
We may not have exclusive rights over the marks that are crucial to our business, including but not limited to Sohu.com, Focus.cn, 17173, Goodfeel , Sogou and Go2Map .
Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely against us, materially disrupt our business.
We may be subject to, and may expend significant resources in defending against claims based on the content and services we provide over all of our Websites.
Activities of Internet content providers are or will be subject to additional PRC regulations, which have not yet been put into effect. Our operations may not be consistent with these new regulations when put into effect, and, as a result, we could be subject to severe penalties.
Regulation and censorship of information distribution in China may adversely affect our business.
Political and economic policies of the PRC government could affect our business.
The PRC legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit the legal protections available to us and you, or could lead to penalties on us.
It may be difficult to enforce any civil judgments against us or our board of directors or officers, because most of our operating and/or fixed assets are located outside of the United States.
If tax benefits presently available to certain of our subsidiaries and VIEs located in China were not available, the income tax rate on most of our profits in China could increase to 33%.
Our subsidiaries and VIEs in China are subject to restrictions on paying dividends or making other payments to our overseas entities.
Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively.
We may suffer currency exchange losses if the RMB depreciates relative to the US Dollar.
The market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for stockholders to sell shares of our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.
We issued $90.0 million of zero coupon convertible senior notes due July 2023 which we may not be able to repay in cash and could result in dilution of our earnings per share.
We are controlled by a small group of our existing stockholders, whose interests may differ from other stockholders.
Anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation and Sohu s Stockholder Rights Plan could delay or deter a change in control.
The power of our Board of Directors to designate and issue shares of preferred stock could have an adverse effect on holders of our common stock.
