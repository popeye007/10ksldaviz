                    Risks Related to Our Business
Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including reducing the volume of the transactions involving our advisory business and reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our private equity funds or traditional asset management business, which, in each case, could materially reduce our revenue or income.
We depend on Mr. Altman, Mr. Beutner and the other members of our Management Committee, including Mr. Aspe, Mr. Mestre, Mr. Taylor and other key personnel, and the loss of their services would have a material adverse effect on us.
Our transition to a corporate structure may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our Senior Managing Directors and other key employees, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and to grow our business.
We have experienced rapid growth over the past several years, which may be difficult to sustain and which may place significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.
If we are unable to consummate or successfully integrate additional acquisitions or joint ventures, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
Our inability to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business.
Our revenue and profits are highly volatile, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.
A general decline in the media or telecommunications sectors could have an adverse effect on our net revenue.
Our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( Section 404 ) could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.
Employee misconduct, which is difficult to detect and deter, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.
The financial services industry faces substantial litigation risks, and we may face damage to our professional reputation and legal liability if our services are not regarded as satisfactory or for other reasons.
Compliance failures and changes in regulation could adversely affect us.
Risks Related to Our Advisory Business
A majority of our revenue is derived from advisory fees, which are not long-term contracted sources of revenue and are subject to intense competition, and declines in our advisory engagements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
A high percentage of our net revenue is derived from a small number of clients and the termination of any one advisory engagement could reduce our revenue and harm our operating results.
If the number of debt defaults, bankruptcies or other factors affecting demand for our restructuring advisory services declines, or we lose business to new entrants into the restructuring advisory business that
are no longer precluded from offering such services due to recent changes to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, our restructuring advisory business revenue could suffer.
We face strong competition from other financial advisory firms, many of which have the ability to offer clients a wider range of products and services than we can offer, which could cause us to fail to win advisory mandates and subject us to pricing pressures that could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
Risks Relating to Our Investment Management Business
If the investments we make on behalf of our funds perform poorly we will suffer a decline in our investment management revenue and earnings, we may be obligated to repay certain incentive fees we have previously received to the third party investors in our funds, and our ability to raise capital for future funds may be adversely affected.
A portion of our investment management activities involve investments in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets, and we may lose some or all of the principal amount we invest in these activities or fail to realize any profits from these activities for a considerable period of time.
Valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can be subject to significant subjectivity and the values of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized, which could result in significant losses for our funds.
Difficult market conditions can reduce the value or performance of the assets we manage in our investment management business, which, in each case, could materially reduce our revenue or income and adversely affect our financial position.
The investment management business is intensely competitive.
The limited partners of the private equity funds we manage may terminate their relationship with us at any time.
The time and attention that our Senior Managing Directors and other employees devote to monetizing the investments of ECP I and EVP will not financially benefit us and may reduce the time and attention these individuals devote to our business. The time and attention that these individuals devote to managing ECP II and the Discovery Fund may not be as profitable to us as other business activities and opportunities to which they might otherwise have devoted their time and attention.
Risks Related to Our International Operations
Our recent acquisitions of our Mexican and English subsidiaries may adversely affect our business.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations.
Adverse economic conditions in Mexico, including interest rate volatility, may result in a decrease in Protego s revenue.
Political events in Mexico, including a change in state and municipal political leadership, may result in disruptions to Protego s business operations and adversely affect its revenue.
The cost of compliance with international employment, labor, benefits and tax regulations may adversely affect our revenue and hamper our ability to expand internationally.
Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure
Our only material asset is our interest in Evercore LP, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from Evercore LP to pay dividends and taxes and other expenses.
We are required to pay our Senior Managing Directors for most of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis step-up we received in connection with the IPO and related transactions.
If Evercore Partners Inc. were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act ) as a result of its ownership of Evercore LP, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock
Control by Messrs. Altman and Beutner of the voting power in Evercore Partners Inc. may give rise to conflicts of interests.
The historical and pro forma financial information in this Form 10-K may not permit you to predict our costs of operations.
Our share price may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale and for exchange.
The market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of our Class A common stock to decline.
Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control.
