                    Risks Related to the Financial Services Industry and Financial Markets
We do not know what impact the U.S. government s various plans to attempt to stabilize the economy and the financial markets will have on our business.
Risks Related To Our Business
The terms of our credit agreement may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes or to take future actions.
We depend on Messrs. Briger, Edens, Kauffman, Nardone and Novogratz, and the loss of any of their services could have a material adverse effect on us.
Several of our funds have key person provisions pursuant to which the failure of one or more of our senior employees to be actively involved in the business provides investors with the right to redeem from the funds or otherwise limits our rights to manage the funds. The loss of the services of any one of such senior employees could have a material adverse effect on certain of our funds to which such key person provisions relate and in some circumstances on us.
Our ability to retain our managing directors is critical to our success and our ability to grow depends on our ability to attract additional key personnel.
We have experienced rapid growth, which may be difficult to sustain and which may place significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.
Operational risks may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth.
Our removal as the investment manager, or the liquidation, of one or more of our funds could have a material negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to third-party litigation risk that could result in significant liabilities and reputational harm, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Our reputation, business and operations could be adversely affected by regulatory compliance failures, the potential adverse effect of changes in laws and regulations applicable to our business and effects of negative publicity surrounding the alternative asset management industry in general.
Congress and foreign regulators have proposed legislation that would require essentially all of our funds to register with the SEC and become subject to full SEC oversight and additional requirements (or, in the case of foreign jurisdictions, would impose a number of other new regulatory requirements), which would increase our costs.
Our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.
Employee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.
The alternate investment management business is intensely competitive, and the industry is in a state of flux.
The due diligence process that we undertake in connection with investments by our investment funds or the public company may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment.
Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.
Our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may enter into new businesses, make future strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business.
Our revenue and profitability fluctuate, particularly inasmuch as we cannot predict the timing of realization events in our private equity and hybrid PE businesses, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause volatility in the price of our Class A shares.
An increase in our borrowing costs may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity.
We have previously participated in large-sized investments, which involve certain complexities and risks that are not encountered in small- and medium-sized investments.
Our investment funds often make investments in companies that we do not control.
Risks Related to Our Funds
The historical performance of our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on our Class A shares.
Poor performance of our funds will cause a decline in our revenue and results of operations, may obligate us to repay incentive income previously paid to us, and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future funds.
Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our funds in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our funds and reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, which could materially reduce our revenue and adversely affect results of operations.
Changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our investment funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing or refinancing for their investments, and may increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, leading to lower-yielding investments and potentially decreasing our incentive income.
We and our funds are subject to counterparty default and concentration risks
Investors in our hedge funds may redeem their investments, and investors in our private equity funds and hybrid PE funds may elect to dissolve the funds, at any time without cause. These events would lead to a decrease in our assets under management (and, therefore, our revenues), which could be substantial and could lead to a material adverse effect on our business.
The hedge fund industry was especially volatile during 2008, and our and other hedge funds may face significant volatility, redemptions and liquidity issues in the future.
Many of our funds invest in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets that often have significantly leveraged capital structures, and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities for a considerable period of time or lose some or all of the principal amount we invest in these activities.
Our funds are subject to risks due to potential illiquidity of assets.
Valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can be subject to significant subjectivity and the values of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized, which could result in significant losses for our funds.
Certain of our funds utilize special situation, distressed debt and mortgage-backed investment strategies that involve significant risks.
If our risk management systems for our hedge fund business are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.
Some of our funds invest in foreign countries and securities of issuers located outside of the United States, which may involve foreign exchange, political, social and economic uncertainties and risks.
Investments by our hedge funds will frequently rank junior to investments made by others in the same company.
Our fund investments are subject to numerous additional risks.
We have been engaged as the investment manager of a third-party investment fund, and we may be engaged as the investment manager of third-party investment funds or managed accounts in the future, and each such engagement exposes us to a number of potential risks.
We are subject to risks in using prime brokers and custodians.
Control by our principals of the combined voting power of our shares and holding their economic interest through Fortress Operating Group may give rise to conflicts of interests.
Our ability to pay regular dividends may be limited by our holding company structure; we are dependent on distributions from the Fortress Operating Group to pay dividends, taxes and other expenses. Our ability to pay dividends is significantly restricted by, and is also subject to not defaulting on, our credit agreement.
Tax consequences to the principals may give rise to conflicts of interests.
We are required to pay our principals for most of the tax benefits we realize as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in connection with taxable exchanges by our principals of units held in the Fortress Operating Group entities or our acquisitions of units from our principals.
If we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our Class A shares.
Risks Related To Our Class A Shares
The market price and trading volume of our Class A shares may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders.
Our Class A share price may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale and for exchange into Class A shares.
Our principals beneficial ownership of Class B shares and anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control.
There are certain provisions in our operating agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors that differ from the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) in a manner that may be less protective of the interests of our Class A shareholders.
We have elected to become a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.
Class A shareholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their share of our taxable income, regardless of whether they receive any cash dividends from us.
Our intermediate holding company, FIG Corp., is subject to corporate income taxation in the United States, and we may be subject to additional taxation in the future.
There can be no assurance that amounts paid as dividends on Class A shares will be sufficient to cover the tax liability arising from ownership of Class A shares.
Tax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.
We currently do not intend to make an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code to adjust our asset basis, so a holder of common units could be allocated more taxable income in respect of those common units prior to disposition than if such an election were made.
If we are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the value of the Class A shares would be adversely affected.
Our structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure also is subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.
We cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, and we have therefore adopted certain income tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of applicable tax requirements. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our common units.
FIG Asset Co. LLC may not be able to invest in certain assets, other than through a taxable corporation.
Complying with certain tax-related requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive business or investment opportunities or enter into acquisitions, borrowings, financings or arrangements we may not have otherwise entered into.
The IRS could assert that we are engaged in a U.S. trade or business, with the result that some portion of our income is properly treated as effectively connected income with respect to non-U.S. holders. Moreover, certain REIT dividends and other stock gains may be treated as effectively connected income with respect to non-U.S. holders.
An investment in Class A shares will give rise to UBTI to certain tax-exempt holders.
We may hold or acquire certain investments through an entity classified as a PFIC or CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Several items of tax legislation are currently being considered which, if enacted, could materially affect us, including by preventing us from continuing to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our structure also is subject to potential judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.
