                    PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
Intense competition in the markets in which TDS operates could adversely affect TDS revenues or increase its costs to compete.
A failure by TDS to successfully execute its business strategy or allocate resources or capital could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
A failure by TDS service offerings to meet customer expectations could limit TDS ability to attract and retain customers and could have an adverse effect on TDS operations.
TDS system infrastructure may not be capable of supporting changes in technologies and services expected by customers, which could result in lost customers and revenues.
An inability to obtain or maintain roaming arrangements with other carriers on terms that are acceptable to TDS could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
TDS currently receives a significant amount of roaming revenues from its wireless business. As a result of acquisitions by other companies in the wireless industry, TDS roaming revenues have declined significantly from amounts earned in certain prior years. Further industry consolidation and continued build outs by existing and new wireless carriers could cause roaming revenues to decline even more, which would have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition and results of operations.
A failure by TDS to obtain access to adequate radio spectrum to meet current or anticipated future needs and/or to accurately predict future needs for radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on TDS business and operations.
To the extent conducted by the FCC, TDS is likely to participate in FCC auctions of additional spectrum in the future as an applicant or as a non-controlling partner in another auction applicant and, during certain periods, will be subject to the FCC s anti-collusion rules, which could have an adverse effect on TDS.
Changes in the regulatory environment or a failure by TDS to timely or fully comply with any applicable regulatory requirements could adversely affect TDS financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business.
Changes in USF funding and/or intercarrier compensation could have a material adverse impact on TDS financial position or results of operations.
An inability to attract and/or retain management, technical, sales and other personnel could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
TDS assets are concentrated in the U.S. telecommunications industry. As a result, its results of operations may fluctuate based on factors related entirely to conditions in this industry.
The completion of acquisitions by other companies has led to increased consolidation in the wireless telecommunications industry. TDS lower scale relative to larger wireless carriers has in the past and could in the future prevent or delay its access to new products including handsets, new technology and/or new content and applications which could adversely affect TDS ability to attract and retain customers and, as a result, could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.
Inability to manage its supply chain or inventory successfully could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in general economic and business conditions, both nationally and in the markets in which TDS operates, could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in various business factors could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
Advances or changes in telecommunications technology, such as Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ), High-Speed Packet Access, WiMAX or Long-Term Evolution ( LTE ), could render certain technologies used by TDS obsolete, could reduce TDS revenues or could increase its costs of doing business.
TDS could incur higher than anticipated intercarrier compensation costs.
TDS is subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments, and the applicability and the amount of these fees are subject to great uncertainty.
Changes in TDS enterprise value, changes in the market supply or demand for wireless licenses or wireline markets, adverse developments in the business or the industry in which TDS is involved and/or other factors could require TDS to recognize impairments in the carrying value of its license costs, goodwill and/or physical assets.
Costs, integration problems or other factors associated with acquisitions/divestitures of properties or licenses and/or expansion of TDS business could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
A significant portion of TDS wireless revenues is derived from customers who buy services through independent agents who market TDS services on a commission basis. If TDS relationships with these agents are seriously harmed, its wireless revenues could be adversely affected.
TDS investments in technologies which are unproven may not produce the benefits that TDS expects.
A failure by TDS to complete significant network construction and systems implementation activities as part of its plans to improve the quality, coverage, capabilities and capacity of its network and support systems could have an adverse effect on its operations.
Financial difficulties (including bankruptcy proceedings) of TDS key suppliers or vendors, termination or impairment of TDS relationships with such suppliers or vendors, or a failure by TDS to manage its supply chain effectively could result in delays or termination of TDS receipt of required equipment or services, or could result in excess quantities of required equipment or services, any of which could adversely affect TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
TDS has significant investments in entities that it does not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on TDS financial condition or results of operations.
A failure by TDS to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technology, or a material disruption thereof, including breaches of network or information technology security, could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
Wars, conflicts, hostilities and/or terrorist attacks or equipment failures, power outages, natural disasters or other events could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
The market prices of TDS Common Shares and Special Common Shares are subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors.
Identification of errors in financial information or disclosures could require amendments to or restatements of financial information or disclosures included in this or prior filings with the SEC.
Restatements of financial statements by TDS and related matters, including resulting delays in filing periodic reports with the SEC, could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
The existence of material weaknesses in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting could result in inaccurate financial statements or other disclosures or failure to prevent fraud, which could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information that affects the calculation of potential liabilities for contingent obligations under guarantees, indemnities, claims, litigation or otherwise, could require TDS to record charges in excess of amounts accrued in the financial statements, if any, which could have an adverse effect on TDS financial condition or results of operations.
Early redemptions or repurchases of debt, issuances of debt, changes in operating leases, changes in purchase obligations or other factors or developments could cause the amounts reported under Contractual Obligations in TDS Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to be different from the amounts actually incurred.
An increase in the amount of TDS debt could subject TDS to higher interest costs and restrictions on its financing, investing and operating activities and could decrease its net income and cash flows.
Disruption in credit or other financial markets, a deterioration of U.S. or global economic conditions or other events, could, among other things, impede TDS access to or increase the cost of financing its operating and investment activities and/or result in reduced revenues and lower operating income and cash flows, which would have an adverse effect on TDS financial condition or results of operations.
Uncertainty of access to capital for telecommunications companies, deterioration in the capital markets, other changes in market conditions, changes in TDS credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to TDS, which could require TDS to reduce its construction, development or acquisition programs.
TDS and U.S. Cellular s credit facilities and the indentures governing their senior notes include restrictive covenants that limit their operating flexibility and TDS and U.S. Cellular may be unable to service their debt or to refinance their indebtedness before maturity.
Changes in income tax rates, laws, regulations or rulings, or federal or state tax assessments, could have an adverse effect on TDS financial condition or results of operations.
Settlements, judgments, restraints on its current or future manner of doing business and/or legal costs resulting from pending and future litigation could have an adverse effect on TDS financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business.
The possible development of adverse precedent in litigation or conclusions in professional studies to the effect that radio frequency emissions from handsets, wireless data devices and/or cell sites cause harmful health consequences, including cancer or tumors, or may interfere with various electronic medical devices such as pacemakers, could have an adverse effect on TDS wireless business, financial condition or results of operations.
Claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, primarily involving patent infringement claims, could prevent TDS from using necessary technology to provide services or subject TDS to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.
Certain matters, such as control by the TDS Voting Trust and provisions in the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of TDS.
Any of the foregoing events or other events could cause revenues, customer additions, operating income, capital expenditures and/or any other financial or statistical information to vary from TDS forward-looking estimates by a material amount.
