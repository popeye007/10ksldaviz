                    We may not be able to sustain growth or profitability.
Our comparable store sales or other operating results may fluctuate significantly. An unanticipated decline in comparable store sales or other operating results may disappoint investors and result in a decline in our stock price.
Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising expenditures in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products.
The mattress industry is highly competitive. Our business could be significantly harmed by existing competitive pressures or from one or more new entrants into the market.
Our products represent a significant departure from traditional innerspring mattresses and the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance would significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our plan to pursue additional and maintain existing wholesale relationships with home furnishings retailers, specialty mattress retailers and the QVC shopping channel may not yield the benefits we expect and may involve other risks that may harm our business.
The failure of our program to place beds in Radisson Hotels and Resorts to achieve planned objectives may harm our business and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.
We rely upon several key suppliers that are, in some instances, our sole source of supply. The failure of one or more of these suppliers or our other key suppliers to supply components for our products on a timely basis, or a material change in the purchase terms for our components, could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

The failure of one or more of these suppliers or our other key suppliers to supply components for our products on a timely basis, or a material change in the purchase terms for our components, could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
We utilize just-in-time manufacturing processes with minimal levels of raw materials, work in process and finished goods inventories, which could leave us vulnerable to shortages of supply of key components. Any such shortage could result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner and lost sales, which could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
The foreign manufacturing of our air chambers and some of our other components involves risks that could increase our costs, lead to inadequate inventory levels or delays in shipping beds to our customers, which could substantially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

We have plans to expand our distribution internationally, which presents some additional risks to our business.
Increases in commodity prices, component costs and/or delivery costs could harm our profitability.
More than one-third of our net sales are financed by a third party. The termination of our agreement with this third party, any material change to the terms of our agreement with this third party or in the availability or terms of credit offered to our customers by this third party, or any delay in securing replacement credit sources, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

The loss of the services of any members of our executive management team could materially and adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy and growth initiatives and could significantly harm our business.
If we are unable to enhance our existing products and to develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to sustain our growth or profitability.
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent other companies from using our technology in competitive products.
We depend upon UPS and other carriers to deliver some of our products to customers on a timely and cost-effective basis. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns and cause us to lose future sales. Any increase in freight charges could increase our costs of doing business and harm our profitability.

Significant and unexpected return rates under our 30-night trial period and warranty claims under our 20-year limited warranty on our beds, in excess of our returns and warranty reserves, could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
We may be unable to effectively manage our growth, which could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our management information systems may prove inadequate.
Damage to either of our manufacturing facilities could increase our costs of doing business or lead to delays in shipping our beds, which could result in increased returns and adversely affect future sales.
Significant and long-term failure of our Web site could adversely affect our net sales.
Our business is subject to seasonal influences and a substantial portion of our net sales is often realized in the last month or last few weeks of a quarter, due in part to our promotional schedule and commission structure. Because the level of our sales and marketing expense is based on our expectations of future customer inquiries and net sales and cannot be adjusted quickly, a shortfall in these expectations may harm our profitability.

We are subject to government regulations relating to the bedding industry and to various aspects of our operations and may be required to incur expenses or to modify our operations in order to ensure compliance with these regulations.
We are subject to class action litigation alleging deceptive trade practices, fraud and breach of warranty. This litigation may be costly to defend, could adversely affect our operating results and, if we are unsuccessful in our defense, could subject our company to material liability.

We depend upon endorsements by national radio personalities to promote our products. The loss of these endorsements, or any reduction in their effectiveness, could adversely affect our net sales and profitability.
The expensing of stock compensation programs required under new accounting rules effective in 2006 may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Additional terrorist attacks in the United States or against U.S. targets or actual or threats of war or the escalation of current hostilities involving the United States or its allies could significantly impact our business, financial condition, operating results or stock price in unpredictable ways.
