                    RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS
We may not be able to achieve or maintain a positive net worth, which would result in requests for additional investment by Treasury.
We are subject to mortgage credit risk. We expect increases in borrower delinquencies and defaults on mortgage loans that we own or that back our guaranteed Fannie Mae MBS to continue to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
The credit losses we experience in future periods as a result of the housing and economic crisis are likely to be larger, perhaps substantially larger, than our current combined loss reserves and will adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
We are in conservatorship and the impact of the conservatorship on the management of our business may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and net worth.
Our multiple roles in the recently announced Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan is likely to increase our costs and place burdens on our resources.
Our efforts to pursue our mission and meet our mission-related goals may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
The conservatorship has no specified termination date, and the future structure of our business following termination of the conservatorship is uncertain.
Our regulator is authorized or required to place us into receivership under specified conditions, which would result in the liquidation of our assets and could have a material adverse effect on holders of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and Fannie Mae MBS.
The investment by Treasury significantly restricts our business activities and requires that we pay substantial dividends and fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and net worth. By its terms, Treasury s investment in our business is indefinite and may be permanent.
Treasury s funding commitment may not be sufficient to keep us in a solvent condition.
We may not be able to rely on the Treasury credit facility in the event of a liquidity crisis.
The conservatorship and investment by Treasury have had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our common and preferred shareholders.
During the second half of 2008, our ability to access the debt capital markets, particularly the long-term or callable debt markets, was limited. Similar limitations in future periods could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations and on our costs, liquidity, business, results of operations, financial condition and net worth.
Our liquidity contingency plan may not provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and meet our obligations in the event that we cannot access the debt capital markets.
Future amendments and guidance from the FASB are expected to impact our accounting treatment, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
A decrease in our credit ratings would have an adverse effect on our ability to issue debt on reasonable terms, which could reduce our earnings and materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our normal business operations and our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
We have experienced significant management changes and we may lose a significant number of valuable employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business and our results of operations.
We are subject to pending government investigations and civil litigation. If it is determined that we engaged in wrongdoing, or if any material litigation is decided against us, we could be required to pay substantial judgments, settlements or other penalties.
The material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
Noncompliance with NYSE rules could result in the delisting of our common and preferred stock from the NYSE.
We may experience further losses and write-downs relating to our investment securities, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
Our business with many of our institutional counterparties is critical and heavily concentrated. If one or more of our institutional counterparties defaults on its obligations to us or becomes insolvent, we could experience substantial losses and it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
We depend on our mortgage insurer counterparties to provide services that are critical to our business. If one or more of these counterparties defaults on its obligations to us or becomes insolvent, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
The success of our efforts to keep people in homes, as well as the re-performance rate of loans we modify, may be limited by our reliance on third parties to service our mortgage loans.
We have several key lender customers, and the loss of business volume from any one of these customers could adversely affect our business and result in a decrease in our market share and earnings.
We rely on internal models to manage risk and to make business decisions. Our business could be adversely affected if those models fail to produce reliable results.
In many cases, our accounting policies and methods, which are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management also may rely on the use of models in making estimates about these matters.
We may be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and net worth.
Changes in option-adjusted spreads or interest rates, or our inability to manage interest rate risk successfully, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
Our business is subject to laws and regulations that restrict our activities and operations, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
Our business faces significant operational risks and an operational failure could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
Mortgage fraud could result in significant financial losses and harm to our reputation.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY
A continuing, or broader, decline in U.S. home prices or activity in the U.S. housing market would negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
Changes in general market and economic conditions in the United States and abroad have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
Our business is subject to economic, legislative and regulatory uncertainty as a result of the current disruption in the housing and mortgage markets.
Defaults by large financial institutions and insurance companies under agreements or instruments with other financial institutions and insurance companies could materially and adversely affect the general market and our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.
