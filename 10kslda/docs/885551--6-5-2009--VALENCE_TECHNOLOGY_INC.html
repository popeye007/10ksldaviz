                    Risks Related to Our Company and Our Business
There is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
General negative economic conditions, including concerns regarding a potential global recession and credit constraints, or unfavorable economic conditions in a particular region, business or industry sector, may lead our customers to delay or forego technology investments and could have other impacts, including but not limited to our ability to access funds on credit and the valuation of our equity securities, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.
Our limited financial resources could materially affect our business, our ability to commercially exploit our technology and our ability to respond to unanticipated development, and could place us at a disadvantage to our competitor.
We have a history of losses and an accumulated deficit and may never achieve or sustain significant revenues or profitability.
Our working capital requirements may increase beyond those currently anticipated.
Our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could materially affect our business and our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.
Our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
Our business will be adversely affected if our Saphion technology-based batteries are not commercially accepted.
If we are unable to develop, manufacture and market products that gain wide customer acceptance, our business will be adversely affected.
Adverse business or financial conditions affecting the automotive industry may have a material adverse effect on our development and marketing partners and our battery business.
We depend on a small number of customers for our revenues, and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we were to lose the business of any one of them.
We have encountered problems in our production process that have limited our ability at times to produce sufficient batteries to meet the demands of our customers. If these issues recur and we are unable to timely resolve these problems, our inability to produce batteries will have a material adverse impact on our ability to grow revenues and maintain our customer base.
We have limited experience manufacturing our products in large quantities.
If our products fail to perform as expected, we could lose existing and future business, and our ability to develop, market and sell our batteries could be harmed.
Our failure to cost-effectively manufacture our technologically-complex batteries in commercial quantities which satisfy our customers product specifications and their expectations for product quality and delivery could damage our customer relationships and result in significant lost business opportunities for us.
In addition to being used in our own product lines, our battery cells are intended to be incorporated into other products. If we do not form effective arrangements with OEMs to commercialize these products, our profitability could be impaired.
Failure to implement an effective licensing business strategy will adversely affect our revenue, cash flow and profitability.
Our dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers for key raw materials may delay our production of batteries.
We expect to sell an increasing portion of our products to, and derive a significant portion of our licensing income from, customers located outside the United States. Foreign government regulations, currency fluctuations and increased costs associated with international sales could make our products and licenses unaffordable in foreign markets, which would reduce our future profitability.
Our business depends on certain key personnel, the loss of whom could weaken our management team, and on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
We may need to expand our employee base and operations in order to effectively distribute our products commercially, which may strain our management and resources and could harm our business.
International political events and the threat of ongoing terrorist activities could interrupt manufacturing of our batteries and our products at our OEM facilities or our own facilities and cause us to lose sales and marketing opportunities.
If we are sued on a product liability claim, our insurance policies may not be sufficient.
Our patent applications may not result in issued patents, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercially exploit our products.
If we cannot protect or enforce our existing intellectual property rights or if our pending patent applications do not result in issued patents, we may lose the advantages of our research and manufacturing systems.
Intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could be time-consuming and expensive to defend, and if any of our products or processes is found to be infringing, we may not be able to procure licenses to use patents necessary to our business at reasonable terms, if at all.
Risks Associated With Doing Business In China
Since our products are manufactured in China and we have transferred additional operations to China, we face risks if China loses normal trade relations status with the United States.
Because the Chinese legal system in general, and the intellectual property regime in particular, are relatively weak, we may not be able to enforce intellectual property rights in China and elsewhere.
Enforcing agreements and laws in China is difficult or may be impossible as China does not have a comprehensive system of laws.
The government of China may change or even reverse its policies of promoting private industry and foreign investment, in which case our assets and operations may be at risk.
The government of China continues to exercise substantial control over the Chinese economy which could have a negative impact on our business.
Changes in China s political and economic policies could harm our business.
Business practices in China may entail greater risk and dependence upon the personal relationships of senior management than is common in North America and therefore some of our agreements with other parties in China could be difficult or impossible to enforce.
Our ongoing manufacturing and development operations in China are complex and having these remote operations may divert management s attention, lead to disruptions in operations and delay implementation of our business strategy.
Our operations could be materially interrupted, and we may suffer significant loss, in the case of fire, casualty or theft at one of our manufacturing or other facilities.
The system of taxation in China is uncertain and subject to unpredictable change that could affect our profitability.
It is uncertain whether we will be able to recover value-added taxes imposed by the Chinese taxing authority.
Any recurrence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian flu, swine flu or other widespread public health problem, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Risks Associated With Our Industry
If competing technologies that outperform our batteries were developed and successfully introduced, then our products might not be able to compete effectively in our targeted market segments.
Our principal competitors generally have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and they may therefore develop batteries similar or superior to ours or otherwise compete more successfully than we do.
Laws regulating the manufacture or transportation of batteries may be enacted which could result in a delay in the production of our batteries or the imposition of additional costs that could harm our ability to be profitable.
Risks Associated With Ownership of Our Stock
Corporate insiders or their affiliates will be able to exercise significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval that might not be in the best interests of our stockholders as a whole.
Some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult, which could depress the price of our stock and limit the price that potential acquirers may be willing to pay for our common stock.
At any given time we might not meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market.
Our stock price is volatile, which could result in a loss of your investment.
Future sales of currently outstanding shares could adversely affect our stock price.
Equity transactions occurring in the future, including sales under our At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, would result in immediate dilution to current equity holders and, as a result, our stock price may go down.
We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and therefore stockholders will be able to recover their investment in our common stock, if at all, only by selling the shares of stock that they hold.
Our business is subject to changing regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance
