Variability in demand for newer operating systems and microprocessor designs may adversely impact our future revenues.
If we fail to renew customer subscriptions and convert free and trial users to paying customers on terms favorable to us, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, either of which could adversely impact our profitability and gross margin.
