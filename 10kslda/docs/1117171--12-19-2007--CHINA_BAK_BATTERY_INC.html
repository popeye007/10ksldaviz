                    Risks Related to Our Business
Our limited operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations.
General economic conditions can significantly affect our financial results.
We are primarily dependent on sales of lithium-ion battery cells for the cellular phone battery replacement market. A reduction in the volume or average price of lithium-ion battery cells that we sell for this market would cause our overall revenue to decline.
Our business depends on the growth in demand for portable electronic devices.
Our future success depends on the success of manufacturers of the end applications that use our products.
We experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
Our failure to keep up with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards may cause our products to become obsolete and less marketable, resulting in loss of market share to our competitors.
A change in our product mix may cause our results of operations to differ substantially from the anticipated results in any particular period.
Failure to successfully obtain OEM certification from international cellular phone brand owners may materially and adversely affect our future growth.
We may not be able to manage our expansion of operations effectively.
We may not be able to substantially increase our manufacturing output in order to maintain our cost competitiveness.
Maintaining our manufacturing operations requires significant capital expenditures, and our inability or failure to maintain our operations would have a material adverse impact on our market share and ability to generate revenue.
We are and will continue to be subject to rapidly declining average selling prices, which may harm our revenue and gross profits.
Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.
We became a public company through our acquisition by a non-operating public shell company, where we were the accounting acquirer and assumed all liabilities of our predecessor entity.
We are dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues and this dependence is likely to continue.
We do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which may result in significant uncertainties and volatility with respect to our revenue from period to period.
We may not be able to accurately plan our production based on our sales contracts, which may result in excess product inventory or product shortages.
We may face impairment charges if economic environments in which our businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions substantially change.
We depend on third parties to supply key raw materials to us. Failure to obtain sufficient supply of these raw materials in a timely fashion and at reasonable costs could significantly delay our production and shipments, which would cause us to breach our sales contracts with our customers.
Fluctuations in prices and availability of raw materials, particularly lithium cobalt dioxide, could increase our costs or cause delays in shipments, which would adversely impact our business and results of operations.
We face intense competition from other battery cell manufacturers, many of which have significantly greater resources.
Our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lost their services.
The success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled employees and key personnel.
Manufacturing or use of our products may cause accidents, which could result in significant production interruption, delay or claims for substantial damages.
We extend relatively long payment terms to our customers.
We manufacture and market lithium-based battery cells only. If a viable substitute product or chemistry emerges and gains market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.
We face risks associated with the marketing, distribution and sale of our products internationally, and if we are unable to effectively manage these risks, they could impair our ability to expand our business abroad.
We rely on third parties whose operations are outside our control.
Defects in our products could result in a loss of customers and decrease in revenue, unexpected expenses and a loss of market share.
We are subject to a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States involving our production of battery cells for A123Systems for use in cordless power tools. If the court holds against us, we may be required to pay monetary damages, terminate our production of the cells, or pay royalties to continue the production. This would in turn materially adversely affect our ability to execute our growth strategy, revenues and business prospects.
We may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, which, if determined adversely to us, could cause our loss of significant rights and inability to continue providing our existing product offerings.
Other future litigation could impact our financial results and condition.
We may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property,
or others may challenge our intellectual property rights
, which could harm our business and competitive position.
We do not hold the land use right for our BAK Industrial Park where our facilities are located, nor did we obtain the required construction and zoning permits for our manufacturing facilities and other related facilities situated on the land.
Compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and our failure to comply with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and a material adverse effect on our business.
We have significant short-term debt obligations, which mature in less than one year. Failure to extend those maturities of, or to refinance, that debt could result in defaults, and in certain instances, foreclosures on our assets. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain financing to fund ongoing operations and future growth.
We have limited insurance coverage against damages or loss we might suffer.
Risks Related to Doing Business in China
Adverse changes in the political and economic policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our competitive position.
A substantial amount of our materials sourcing originates in China.
We may be unable to enforce our legal rights due to policies regarding the regulation of foreign investments in China as well as other aspects of the Chinese legal system.
We currently enjoy a reduced tax rate and other government incentives, and the loss of or reduction in these benefits may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
We rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs.
Governmental control of currency conversion may affect our ability to satisfy our non-RMB obligations.
Fluctuation in the value of the RMB may result in foreign currency translation losses or in increased costs to us.
Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us.
Investors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws against us or our management.
An outbreak of a pandemic avian influenza, SARS or other contagious disease may have an adverse effect on the economies of certain Asian countries and may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our production facilities are subject to risks of power shortages.
Implementation of the PRC s new corporate income tax law may adversely affect us.
Changes in PRC property rights law may affect our interests in our properties.
The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.
Future inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business profitably in China.
We may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations implemented on September 8, 2006.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
The market price for our common stock may be volatile.
Our directors and executive officers, collectively, own approximately 39.7% of our outstanding common stock and may be able to control our management and affairs.
Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could entrench our board of directors and prevent a change in control.
We are obligated to indemnify our officers and directors for certain losses they suffer.
