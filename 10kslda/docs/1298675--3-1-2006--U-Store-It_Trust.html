                    Risks Related to Our Operations
Our rental revenues are significantly influenced by the economies and other conditions of the markets in which we operate, particularly in Florida, California, Ohio, Illinois and Texas where we have high concentrations of self-storage facilities.
Because we are primarily focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of self-storage facilities, our rental revenues are significantly influenced by demand for self-storage space generally, and a decrease in such demand would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio.
We face significant competition in the self-storage industry, which may impede our ability to retain customers or re-let space when existing customers vacate, or impede our ability to make, or increase the cost of, future acquisitions or developments.
Our rental revenues and operating costs, as well as the value of our self-storage facilities, are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry.
If we are unable to promptly re-let units within our facilities or if the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than expected, our rental revenues would be adversely affected and our growth may be impeded.
We may not be successful in identifying and completing acquisitions or development projects that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth, and even if we are able to identify suitable projects, our future acquisitions and developments may not yield the returns we expect or may result in shareholder dilution.
We may not be able to adapt our management and operation systems to respond to the integration of additional facilities without disruption or expense.
We depend on our on-site personnel to maximize customer satisfaction at each of our facilities; any difficulties we encounter in hiring, training and retaining skilled field personnel may adversely affect our rental revenues.
We had approximately $669.3 million of indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2005, and this level of indebtedness will result in significant debt service obligations, impede our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund our growth and expose us to refinancing risk.
Our mortgage indebtedness contains covenants that restrict our operating, acquisition and disposition activities.
Mortgage debt obligations expose us to the possibility of foreclosure, which could result in the loss of our investment in a facility or group of facilities subject to mortgage debt.
We could have substantial variable rate debt, and therefore increases in interest rates would likely increase our debt service obligations.
Our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur. As a result, we may become highly leveraged in the future.
We may not be able to sell facilities when appropriate or on favorable terms, which could significantly impede our ability to respond to economic or other market conditions or adverse changes in the performance of our facilities.
Potential losses may not be covered by insurance, which could result in the loss of our investment in a facility and the future cash flows from the facility.
Rising operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and funds available for future distributions.
We could incur significant costs related to government regulation and environmental matters.
We must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which may require unanticipated expenditures.
We may become subject to litigation or threatened litigation which may divert management time and attention, require us to pay damages and expenses or restrict the operation of our business.
If in the future we elect to make joint venture investments, we could be adversely affected by a lack of sole decision-making authority, reliance on joint venture partners financial condition and any disputes that might arise between us and our joint venture partners.
Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure
Our organizational documents contain provisions that may have an anti-takeover effect, which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise benefit our shareholders.
Our charter prohibits any person (other than members of the Amsdell family and related family trusts and entities which, as a group, may own up to 29% of our common shares) from beneficially owning more than 5% of our common shares (or up to 9.8% in the case of certain designated investment entities, as defined in our declaration of trust).
Our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue preferred shares with terms that may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise benefit our shareholders.
Our management has limited experience operating a REIT and a public company and therefore, may not be able to successfully operate our company as a REIT and as a public company.
Certain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control, which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise benefit our shareholders.
Robert J. Amsdell, Barry L. Amsdell, Todd C. Amsdell and the Amsdell Entities collectively own an approximate 16.8% beneficial interest in our company on a fully diluted basis and therefore have the ability to exercise significant influence on our company and any matter presented to our shareholders.
Robert J. Amsdell, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Barry L. Amsdell, one of our trustees, have interests, through their ownership of limited partner units in our operating partnership and their ownership, through Rising Tide Development, of the option facilities, that may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders.
Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has outside business interests that could require significant time and attention and may interfere with his ability to devote time to our business and affairs.
Our business could be harmed if any of our key personnel, Robert J. Amsdell, Steven G. Osgood, Todd C. Amsdell and Tedd D. Towsley, all of whom have long-standing business relationships in the self-storage industry, terminated his employment with us.
We depend on external sources of capital that are outside of our control; the unavailability of capital from external sources could adversely affect our ability to acquire or develop facilities, satisfy our debt obligations and/or make distributions to shareholders.
Our shareholders have limited control to prevent us from making any changes to our investment and financing policies that they believe could harm our business, prospects, operating results or share price.
Our rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our trustees and officers are limited, and therefore our and our shareholders ability to recover damages from our trustees and officers is limited.
We may have assumed unknown liabilities in connection with our formation transactions that occurred at the time of our IPO and will not have recourse to Robert J. Amsdell, Barry L. Amsdell, Todd C. Amsdell and the Amsdell Entities for any of these liabilities.
Our share price could be volatile and could decline, resulting in a substantial or complete loss on your investment.
If a large number of our common shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common shares and impede our ability to raise future capital.
If we fail to qualify as a REIT, our distributions to shareholders would not be deductible for federal income tax purposes, and therefore we would be required to pay corporate tax at applicable rates on our taxable income, which would substantially reduce our earnings and may substantially reduce the value of our common shares and adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.
