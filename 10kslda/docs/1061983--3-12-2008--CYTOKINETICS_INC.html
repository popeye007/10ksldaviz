                    We currently finance and plan to continue to finance our operations through the sale of equity, strategic alliances and debt financings, which may result in additional dilution to our stockholders, relinquishment of valuable technology rights or the imposition of restrictive covenants, or which may cease to be available on attractive terms or at all.
Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval.
Clinical trials are expensive, time consuming and subject to delay.
We have limited capacity to carry out our own clinical trials in connection with the development of our drug candidates and potential drug candidates and, to the extent we elect to develop a drug candidate without a strategic partner, we will need to expand our development capacity and will require additional funding.
We depend on GSK for the conduct, completion and funding of the clinical development and commercialization of GSK-923295.
If we fail to enter into and maintain successful strategic alliances for certain of our drug candidates or potential drug candidates, we may have to reduce or delay our development of those drug candidates and potential drug candidates or increase our expenditures.
The success of our development activities depends in part on the performance of our strategic partners and the NCI, over which we have little or no control.
We have no manufacturing capacity and depend on our strategic partners or contract manufacturers to produce our clinical trial drug supplies for each of our drug candidates and potential drug candidates, and anticipate continued reliance on contract manufacturers for the development and commercialization of our potential drugs.
We may not be able to successfully scale-up manufacture of our drug candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, which would delay or prevent us from developing our drug candidates and commercializing resulting approved drugs, if any.
We currently have no marketing or sales staff, and if we are unable to enter into or maintain strategic alliances with marketing partners or if we are unable to develop our own sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing our potential drugs.
Our focus on the discovery and development of drug candidates directed against specific proteins and pathways within the cytoskeleton is unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any drug candidates of commercial value.
Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies, drug candidates and potential drug candidates.
If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome would have a significant adverse effect on our business.
We may become involved in disputes with our strategic partners over intellectual property ownership, and publications by our research collaborators and scientific advisors could impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which, in either case, would have a significant impact on our business.
To the extent we elect to fund the development of a drug candidate or the commercialization of a drug at our expense, we will need substantial additional funding.
We expect to expand our development, clinical research, sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.
The failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could impair our drug development and commercialization activities.
Risks Related To Our Industry
Our competitors may develop drugs that are less expensive, safer or more effective, which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any drugs that we may commercialize.
The regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent our partners or us from obtaining approvals to commercialize some or all of our drug candidates.
If we or our partners receive regulatory approval for our drug candidates, we will also be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review, such as continued safety reporting requirements, and we may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations, all of which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize our potential drugs.
If physicians and patients do not accept our drugs, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.
The coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved drugs is uncertain and failure to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement could limit our ability to market any drugs we may develop and decrease our ability to generate revenue.
We may be subject to costly product liability or other liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance.
We may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.
We use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business. Responding to any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.
Our facilities in California are located near an earthquake fault, and an earthquake or other types of natural disasters, catastrophic events or resource shortages could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results.
Risks Related To Our Common Stock
We expect that our stock price will fluctuate significantly, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your investment price.
If the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause our stock price to decline.
Evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty.
Volatility in the stock prices of other companies may contribute to volatility in our stock price.
We have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Our common stock is thinly traded and there may not be an active, liquid trading market for our common stock.
Risks Related To Our Financing Vehicles and Investments
Our committed equity financing facility with Kingsbridge may not be available to us if we elect to make a draw down, may require us to make additional blackout or other payments to Kingsbridge, and may result in dilution to our stockholders.
