                    Harland Clarke Holdings and Mafco Worldwide s ability to make payments on their indebtedness depends on their ability to generate sufficient cash in the future.

Covenant restrictions under our subsidiaries indebtedness may limit each subsidiary s ability to operate its respective business.
Risks Related to Our Business

We may be subject to sales and other taxes, which could have adverse effects on our business.

Errors, defects or other performance problems of our products could result in harm or damage to our clients and expose us to liability, which may adversely affect our business and operating results.
