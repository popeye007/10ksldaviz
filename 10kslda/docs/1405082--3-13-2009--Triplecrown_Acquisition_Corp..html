                    Risks associated with our business
We are a development stage company with no operating history and very limited operating resources.
We may not be able to consummate a business combination within the required time frame, in which case, we would be forced to liquidate our assets.
If we are unable to consummate a business combination, holders of IPO Shares will be forced to wait until October 22, 2009 before receiving liquidation distributions.
If we do not conduct an adequate due diligence investigation of a target business with which we combine, we may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring, and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.
If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share liquidation price received by stockholders will be less than approximately $9.76 per share.
Holders of IPO Shares may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.
An effective registration statement may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise his, her or its warrants and causing such warrants to be practically worthless.
An investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of common stock upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.
Because there are numerous companies with a business plan similar to ours seeking to effectuate a business combination, it may be more difficult for us to do so.
Since we have not yet selected any target business with which to complete a business combination, you will be unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the business s operations.
We may issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.
Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.
Our ability to successfully effect a business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following a business combination.
Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following a business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.
Our officers and directors allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination.
Our officers and directors are now and may in the future become affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those conducted by us and accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
All of our officers and directors own Founder Shares and some of them own sponsors warrants. These shares and warrants will not participate in liquidation distributions and, therefore, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for a business combination.
The NYSE Amex may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
After our business combination, we will be solely dependent on a single business and a limited number of products or services.
The ability of our stockholders to exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.
The current global credit crisis could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete an initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business.
We may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.
We may proceed with an initial business combination even if public stockholders owning 16,559,999 of the IPO Shares exercise their conversion rights.
Because of our limited resources and structure, we may not be able to consummate a business combination with growth potential.
We may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel us to restructure the transaction or abandon a particular business combination.
Our Founders, including our officers and directors, control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring stockholder vote.
Our outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of common stock and make it more difficult to effect a business combination.
If our Founders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect a business combination.
Our management s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.
If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination.
If we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.
If we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such company will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.
Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may not be able to complete a business combination with some prospective target businesses.
Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.
Risks Related to the Financial Services Industry
The financial services industry has been adversely affected by the global credit crisis.
The financial services industry faces substantial regulatory and litigation risks and conflicts of interest, and, after the consummation of a business combination with a company in the financial services industry, we may face legal liability and reduced revenues and profitability if our services are not regarded as compliant or for other reasons.
After the consummation of our initial business combination, we will face strong competition from financial services firms, many of whom have the ability to offer clients a wider range of products and services than we may be able to offer, which could lead to pricing pressures that could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
The financial services industry has inherent risks, which may affect our net income and revenues.
Operational risks may disrupt our business, result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth.
Many financial services firms face credit risks which, if not properly managed, could cause revenues and net income to decrease.
