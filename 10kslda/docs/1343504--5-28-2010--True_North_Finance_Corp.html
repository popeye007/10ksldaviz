                    We may not sell enough Bonds to successfully pursue our business model, which would result in our not being able to repay the Bonds.
We have limited operating history for you to evaluate and determine if we have the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the Bonds.
Our organization documents require us to distribute 50% of our net income to our preferred shareholders which will decrease our future liquidity and retained earnings.
Our Bonds are not insured or guaranteed by any third party and repayment is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow.
Payment on the Bonds is subordinate to the payment of all outstanding senior debt, and the indenture does not limit the amount of senior debt we may incur.
The indenture does not contain covenants to protect your investment in the Bonds.
There is no sinking fund to ensure repayment of the Bonds and repayment is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash at maturity.
If we redeem the Bonds, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable rates.
If we are unable to attract customers and complete additional financing transactions, we will have insufficient revenue to repay the Bonds.
We may change the interest rates on any subsequent series of securities that may be offered, provided that no such change shall affect any Bond of any series issued prior to the date of change.
Risks Related to Our Business/Lending
Because there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, there is substantial uncertainty we will continue activities in which case you could lose your investment.
We expect to incur a significant amount of debt to finance our portfolio which may subject us to an increased risk of loss or adversely affect the return on our investments.
To the extent it is determined this Company violated securities laws, we may have to pay a substantial penalty.
We may not be able to access financing sources on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.
Our indebtedness may require us to provide collateral or comply with other borrowing conditions.
Interest rate fluctuations and/or loan prepayments could reduce our ability to generate income on our loan portfolio or anticipated yields on our investments.
We may suffer a loss in the event of a bankruptcy of a borrower, particularly in cases where the borrower has incurred debt that is senior to our loan.
If our reserves for loan losses are inadequate to cover actual loan losses, or if loan delinquencies increase, our earnings could decrease.
We are subject to the risk that provisions of our loan agreements may be unenforceable.
We may fail to perfect security interests in certain collateral pledged by the borrowers of our loans.
Our real estate loans are illiquid, which could restrict our ability to respond rapidly to changes in economic conditions.
We may be affected adversely if guaranties made to us are found unenforceable.
We will be dependent on the credit decisions, solvency and willingness to do business with us to the extent we invest through other finance companies.
Our borrowers credit enhancements may lapse or be insufficient to collateralize interest payments.
Lack of insurance will increase the risk that we may suffer a loss and our borrower(s) would be unable to repay all or a portion of the loans.
Failure to introduce new financial/lending products and services successfully may cause us to lose market share.
If we are unable to pay any of our creditors, we may have to liquidate our assets for less than fair market value which would substantially reduce our ability to repay the Bonds.
Our lack of a significant line of credit could affect our liquidity and ability to repay the Bonds.
If we cannot collect all of our finance receivables, our ability to repay the Bonds will be impaired.
A default by our borrowers will increase the risk that we may not generate sufficient cash to repay the Bonds.
If we default under the Bonds or the indenture, the trustee will be paid all amounts owed the trustee before any payments are made to holders of Bonds.
Our lack of assets will increase the risk that we may not be able to make interest payments on the Bonds.
Foreclosure by a priority lien holder may result in the loss of our investment and impair our ability to repay the Bonds.
Our focus on credit-impaired borrowers will make our investment portfolio susceptible to high levels of default resulting in risk to our investors.
Our practice of deferring principal payments on land development loans until the senior lender has been paid off may result in losing some of the value of our collateral and our inability to repay all or a portion of the Bonds.
Because we have not currently retained any investment pod managers, there can be no assurance that our investment objective will be achieved or that a holder of a Bond will not lose a portion or all of his or her investment.
Conflicts of interest may reduce our profitability and ability to repay the Bonds.
We have a limited operating history and limited experience operating as a company and we may not be able to successfully operate our business or generate sufficient revenue.
Our Investment Committee has broad discretion as to the kinds of investments the Company makes and the borrowers to whom the Company lends. Such broad discretion may result in our making riskier investments.
We are dependent upon certain executives and key personnel of the Company and may not find a suitable replacement if any such executives or key personnel are no longer available to us.
Risks Related to the Market
Our financial results may be adversely affected by adverse conditions in the real estate finance sector, including decreases in real estate values, changes in interest rates that cause a decrease in interest rate spreads, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and other significant external events.
In a period of rising interest rates, our interest expense could increase while the interest we earn on our fixed-rate assets would not change which would adversely affect us.
Lack of diversification may increase our dependence on individual borrowers.
A decline in the real estate development and construction markets will partially impair our ability to make investments in certain investment markets.
We may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic changes in geographic areas where our current properties are concentrated.
We may be adversely affected by acts of God frequent to geographic areas where our properties are concentrated.
A decline in real estate value will impair the collateral for our investments thereby increasing the likelihood that we would suffer a loss and be unable to repay all or a portion of the Bonds upon liquidation of the collateral.
Additional competition may decrease our liquidity and profitability, which would adversely affect our ability to repay the Bonds.
The current dislocations in the sub-prime mortgage sector, and the current weakness in the broader financial market, could adversely affect us and our ability to fund our business, which could result in increases in our borrowing costs, reduction in our liquidity and reductions in the value of the investments in our portfolio.
We are subject to many laws and governmental regulations. Any changes in these laws or regulations, or our non-compliance with these laws and regulations may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
The impact of certain environmental laws and regulations may result in the collateral for our investments losing value.
Our operations are not subject to regulatory requirements designed to protect investors and an investment in the Bonds will not enjoy the same regulatory protection received by investors in other regulated businesses.
Absence of a market for our investments will increase the risk that we may not generate sufficient cash at maturity to pay the Bonds.
If we do not obtain necessary licenses and approvals, we will not be legally permitted to acquire, fund or originate mezzanine loans and/or other loans in some states, which would adversely affect our operations.
Our mezzanine lending activities may be riskier than other lending activities.
