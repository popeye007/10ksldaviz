                    Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results
Changes in our management may cause uncertainty in, or be disruptive to, our business.
A number of our current and former executive officers and directors have been named as parties to several purported class action and derivative action lawsuits relating to our past option granting practices, and there is a possibility of additional lawsuits, all of which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses.
We have been named as a party to several purported class action and derivative lawsuits relating to our past option granting practices, and we may be named in additional litigation, all of which could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.
Our tentative settlement of the consolidated shareholder derivative action requires the court's preliminary and final approval, and may not be approved by the court.
Matters related to the internal review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our financial statements may result in additional litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions, and could have a negative impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results.
Class action litigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.
We have had and continue to have material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be filed on a timely basis and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.
If the recent worsening of credit market conditions continues or increases, it could have a material adverse impact on our investment portfolio.
There are numerous risks with our acquisition of the Intel communications and application processor business
Our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions could harm our operating results and share price.
We have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments which could divert management's attention, cause ownership dilution to our shareholders, be difficult to integrate and adversely affect our financial results.
A significant portion of our business is dependent on the hard disk drive industry, which is highly cyclical, experiences rapid technological change, and is facing increased competition from alternate technologies.
Our sales are concentrated in a few customers and if we lose or experience a significant reduction in sales to any of these key customers, our revenues may decrease substantially.
If we are unable to accurately predict our future sales and to appropriately budget for our expenses, our operating results could suffer.
Our financial and operating results may vary which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
Changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue and expense fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.
If we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner, our operating results and competitive position will be harmed.
If we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products and services or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
We rely on independent foundries and subcontractors for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our integrated circuit products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our growth.
Our operations located in the State of Israel may be harmed by adverse political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel.
We rely on third-party distributors and manufacturers' representatives and the failure of these distributors and manufacturers' representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales.
We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our profit margin, or, conversely, we may have insufficient inventory, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially in loss of market share and damaged customer relationships.
Our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with customers. If we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor's solutions instead of buying our products, our operating results would be adversely affected.
We may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration, which may result in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses.
We have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.
We are subject to the risks of owning real property.
We depend on key personnel with whom we do not have employment agreements to manage our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed.
Our officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock, and two of them, together with another employee, are also significant shareholders and are related by blood or marriage. These factors may allow the officers and directors as a group or the three related employees to greatly influence the election of directors and the approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions.
We face foreign business, political and economic risks, which may harm our results of operations, because a majority of our products and our customers' products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States.
The average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future, which could harm our revenues and gross profits.
We have a lengthy and expensive product sales cycle that does not assure product sales, and that if unsuccessful, may harm our operating results.
We must keep pace with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry to remain competitive.
We may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.
We may become involved with costly and lengthy litigation, which could subject us to liability, require us to obtain or renew licenses or stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products.
We are incorporated in Bermuda, and, as a result, it may not be possible for our shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.
Our Bye-laws contain a waiver of claims or rights of action by our shareholders against our officers and directors, which will severely limit our shareholders' right to assert a claim against our officers and directors under Bermuda law.
Tax benefits we receive may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our costs.
Our Bye-laws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in corporate control, even if the change in corporate control would benefit our shareholders.
