                    Our operating results are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry where we or our customers operate. These factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability.
Our crop nutrients and other products are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate.
Our crop nutrient business is increasingly seasonal, which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital, and our inability to predict future seasonal crop nutrient demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages.
Important raw materials and energy used in our businesses in the past have been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing. In addition, in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities, alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities. Changes in the price of our raw materials or disruptions to supply could have a material impact on our businesses.
We are subject to risks associated with our international operations, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in foreign countries.
Our international assets are located in countries with volatile conditions, which could subject us and our assets to significant risks.
Adverse weather conditions, including the impact of potential hurricanes and excess rainfall, have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations, particularly our Phosphates business, and result in increased costs, deceased production and potential liabilities.
Our operations are dependent on having received the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities. A decision by a government agency to deny any of our permits and approvals or to impose restrictive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations.
Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our sales and profitability. These competitors include state-owned and government subsidized entities in other countries.
The environmental regulations to which we are subject, as well as our potential environmental liabilities, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2006. The material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could result in a material error in our financial statements.
We are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system with additional controls. Failure to fully implement the new system in an effective and a timely fashion will delay our ability to fully correct the material weaknesses we have identified in our internal controls.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.
We need significant amounts of cash to service our indebtedness. If we are unable to generate a sufficient amount of cash to service our indebtedness, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.
The agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants. The failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.
We do not own a controlling equity interest in our non-consolidated companies, some of which are foreign companies, and therefore our operating results and cash flow may be materially affected by how the governing boards and majority owners operate such businesses. There may also be limitations on monetary distributions from these companies that are outside of our control. Together, these factors may lower our equity earnings or cash flow from such businesses and negatively impact our results of operations.
Strikes or other forms of work stoppage or slowdown could disrupt our business and lead to increased costs.
Our Esterhazy mine has experienced an inflow of water for more than 20 years. We are not insured against the risk of floods and water inflow at that mine and the costs to control the water inflow could increase in future years. The water inflow, risk to employees or remediation costs could also cause us to change our mining process or abandon the mines, which in turn could significantly negatively impact our results of operations.
Deliberate, malicious acts, including terrorism, could damage our facilities, disrupt our operations or injure employees, contractors, customers or the public and result in liability to us.
We may be adversely affected by changing antitrust laws to which we are subject.
Our competitive position could be adversely affected if we are unable to participate in continuing industry consolidation.
Our risk management strategy may not be effective.
Our recent closures of several facilities in our Florida Phosphates operations may cost more than we estimate, result in less benefits than we expect or require us to obtain waivers of financial assurance requirements from governmental regulatory agencies.
Cargill s status as a significant stockholder and its representation on our Board of Directors may create conflicts of interest with our other stockholders and could cause us to take actions that our other stockholders do not support.
Cargill s significant ownership interest in Mosaic and our classified Board of Directors and other anti-takeover provisions could deter an acquisition proposal for Mosaic that other stockholders may consider favorable.
Our stockholders may be adversely affected by the expiration of the lockup and standstill restrictions in our Investor Rights Agreement with Cargill, which would enable Cargill to, among other things, transfer all or a significant percentage of its interest in our common stock to a third party, increase its ownership percentage of the our common stock above 65.3% or seek additional representation on our Board of Directors, any of which could have an impact on the price of our common stock.
We may experience difficulty in establishing a separate brand identity from Cargill, which could negatively affect our sales and operating results.
Our success will depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our businesses.
A shortage of railcars, barges and ships for carrying our products and the raw materials we use in our business could result in customer dissatisfaction, loss of production or sales, and higher transportation or equipment costs.
We extend trade credit to our customers and guarantee the financing that some of our customers use to purchase our products. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or their financing from their banks.
Our current corporate organizational structure results in a high effective tax rate and does not optimize our ability to utilize cash generated by our profitable Canadian potash operations.
