                    Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results
A significant portion of our business is dependent upon the hard disk drive industry, which is highly cyclical, experiences rapid technological change, and is facing increased competition from alternate technologies.
We depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our sales. The loss of, or a significant reduction or cancellation in sales to, any key customer would significantly reduce our revenues.
If we are unable to accurately predict our future sales and to appropriately budget for our expenses, our operating results can suffer.
Because we expect to experience lower sequential growth rates in future periods, investors should not rely on our historical growth rates when evaluating our business.
Changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will adversely affect our results of operations.
If we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner, our operating results and competitive position will be harmed.
If we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products and services or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
We rely on independent foundries and subcontractors for the manufacture, assembly and testing of our integrated circuit products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our growth.
Our Marvell Semiconductor Israel Ltd., Marvell T.I. Ltd. and RADLAN Computer Communications Ltd. subsidiaries are incorporated under the laws of, and their principal offices are located in, the State of Israel and therefore their business operations may be harmed by adverse political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel.
Past acquisitions and any future acquisitions or transactions may not be successful.
Our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions could harm our operating results and share price.
We rely on third-party distributors and manufacturers representatives and the failure of these distributors and manufacturers representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales.
We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our profit margin, or, conversely, we may have insufficient inventory, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially in loss of market share and damaged customer relationships.
The uncertain and volatile worldwide economy, acts of war, terrorism, international conflicts and related uncertainties may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.
We are a mid-sized company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors, and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase or maintain revenue and market share.
Because we do not have long-term commitments from our customers, we must estimate customer demand, and errors in our estimates can have negative effects on our inventory levels, sales and operating results.
Our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with customers. If we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products, our operating results would be adversely affected.
If our foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields or quality, our relationships with our customers and our reputation will be harmed.
When demand for foundry capacity is high, we may take various actions to try to secure sufficient capacity, which may be costly and harm our operating results.
The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses or undetected defects or bugs, which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, and materially and adversely affect our operating costs.
We may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration, which may result in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.
We are subject to the risks of owning real property.
We depend on key personnel with whom we do not have employment agreements to manage our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed.
Our officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock, and three existing directors, who are also significant shareholders, are related by blood or marriage. These factors may allow the officers and directors as a group or the three related directors to greatly influence the election of directors and the approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions.
We face foreign business, political and economic risks, which may harm our results of operations, because a majority of our products and our customers products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States.
Our third-party foundries and subcontractors are concentrated in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Pan-Pacific region, an area subject to significant earthquake risks. Any disruption to the operations of these foundries and subcontractors resulting from earthquakes or other natural disasters could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products.
The average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future, which could harm our revenues and gross profits.
We have a lengthy and expensive product sales cycle that does not assure product sales, and that if unsuccessful, may harm our operating results.
We must keep pace with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry to remain competitive.
We may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.
We may become involved with costly and lengthy litigation, which could subject us to liability, require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products.
We are incorporated in Bermuda, and, as a result, it may not be possible for our shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.
Our By-laws contain a waiver of claims or rights of action by our shareholders against our officers and directors, which will severely limit our shareholders right to assert a claim against our officers and directors under Bermuda law.
Tax benefits we receive may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our costs.
Class action litigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources.
Our By-laws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in corporate control, even if the change in corporate control would benefit our shareholders.
