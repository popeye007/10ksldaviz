                    We depend heavily on our two marketed products, Tarceva and Macugen to generate revenues in order to fund our operations and, to a lesser extent, potential upfront fees, milestones and royalties from the licensing of our DPIV patent estate.
If our competitors succeed in developing products and technologies that are more effective than our own, or if scientific developments change our understanding of the potential scope and utility of our products, then our products and technologies may be rendered less competitive.
We depend heavily on our co-development and marketing alliance with Genentech and Roche for Tarceva. If Genentech or Roche terminate these alliances, or are unable to meet their contractual obligations, it would negatively impact our revenues and harm our business.
We depend heavily on our collaboration with Pfizer for the continued development and commercialization of Macugen. Our relationship with Pfizer involves a complex sharing of control over decisions, responsibilities, and costs and benefits. Any loss of Pfizer as a collaborator, or any adverse development in the collaboration, could harm or cause a delay in the continued development and commercialization of Macugen.
Our revenues from our DPIV patent portfolio licenses are contingent upon the ability of the licensees to successfully develop and commercialize their products which are the subject of these licenses.
Our outstanding indebtedness increased substantially with the issuance of our 3.25% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2023, or the 2023 Notes, and the 2025 Notes; we
may not be able to make the required payments on any of these notes when due and therefore we may face liquidity problems.
Although we have clinical candidates in the pipeline for oncology, diabetes and obesity and ophthalmology, that appear to be promising at early stages of development, none of these potential products may reach the commercial market for a number of reasons.
If any of our current or future marketed products, including Tarceva or Macugen, were to become the subject of problems related to their efficacy, safety, or otherwise, or if new, more effective treatments were introduced into the market, our revenues from our marketed products could decrease.
We are responsible for the manufacture and supply of Tarceva and Macugen in the United States. Because we have no commercial manufacturing facilities, we are dependent on two suppliers for the API for Tarceva, a single supplier for the tableting of Tarceva in the United States and third parties for the manufacture of Macugen. If any of these third parties fails to meet its obligations, our revenues from our marketed products could be negatively affected.
A component of our business strategy is to enter into collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize certain of our products when we believe that doing so will maximize product value. We may not be successful in establishing such collaborations, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize certain of our products.
Our reliance on third parties, such as clinical research organizations, or CROs, may result in delays in completing, or a failure to complete, clinical trials if they fail to perform under our agreements with them.
Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters
The manufacture and packaging of pharmaceutical products such as Tarceva and Macugen are subject to the requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies. If we or our third party manufacturers fail to satisfy these requirements, our or their product development and commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.
If government agencies do not grant us or our collaborative partners required approvals for any of our potential products in a timely manner or at all, we or our collaborative partners will not be able to distribute or sell our products currently under development.
Competitors could challenge our patents and file an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) new drug application for a generic or a modified version of Tarceva or Macugen and adversely affect their competitive position.
Some of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and false or fraudulent claims.
If we do not receive adequate third-party reimbursement for the sales of our marketed products, we may not be able to sell such products on a profitable basis.
The 2003 Medicare prescription drug coverage legislation, The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act, or the MMA, and future legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell certain of our products, including Macugen, profitably.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Legal Matters
If we or our collaborative partners are required to obtain licenses from third parties, our revenues and royalties on any commercialized products could be reduced.
If we cannot successfully protect, exploit or enforce our intellectual property rights, our ability to develop and commercialize our products will be severely limited.
If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be negatively impacted.
The failure to prevail in litigation or the costs of litigation, including patent infringement claims, could harm our financial performance and business operations and could cause delays in product introductions.
The use of any of our potential products in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products exposes us to liability claims.
If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license development or commercialization rights to products or technology from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
Our stock price remains highly volatile which could make it difficult for our stockholders to resell our common stock.
We have outstanding options, convertible debt, contingent value rights and warrants, the exercise, conversion or exchange of which could dilute stockholder value and cause our stock price to decline.
Our governance documents and state law provide certain anti-takeover measures which will discourage a third party from seeking to acquire us and may impede the ability of stockholders to remove and replace our board of directors and, therefore, our management.
