                    Should any of our existing aircraft or our new order of 747-8F aircraft become underutilized by our businesses, failure to re-deploy these aircraft at favorable rates or to successfully and timely dispose of such aircraft could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The current global financial crisis could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to access capital markets.
We have a number of contractual obligations, including progress payments, associated with our order of 12 747-8F aircraft. If we are unable to obtain financing for these aircraft and/or make the required progress payments, our growth strategy would be disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Our financial condition could suffer if we experience unanticipated costs or enforcement action as a result of the Department of Justice fuel surcharge investigation and other lawsuits and claims.
While our revenues may vary significantly over time, a substantial portion of our operating expenses are fixed. These fixed costs may limit our ability to quickly change our cost structure to respond to any declines in our revenues, which could reduce our profitability.
We have a limited number of revenue producing assets. The loss of one or more of our aircraft for an extended period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our substantial lease and debt obligations, including aircraft lease and other obligations, could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or capital requirements, all of which could limit our financial resources and ability to compete, and may make us more vulnerable to adverse economic events.
Certain of our debt obligations contain a number of restrictive covenants. In addition, many of our debt and lease obligations have cross default and cross acceleration provisions.
Global trade flows are typically seasonal, and our business segments, including our ACMI customers business, experience seasonal revenue variation.
Fuel price volatility could adversely affect our business and operations in our Commercial Charter business.
We are party to collective bargaining agreements covering our U.S. crewmembers, and obligated to negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering our U.S. dispatchers, that could result in higher labor costs than those faced by some of our non-unionized competitors, putting us at a competitive disadvantage, and/or resulting in a work interruption or stoppage, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement and other rules and regulations that add costs to our business. A violation of these rules and regulations could lead to termination or suspension of our government contracts and could prevent us from entering into contracts with government agencies in the future.
Our insurance coverage may become more expensive and difficult to obtain and may not be adequate to insure all risks.
Some of our aircraft are periodically deployed in potentially dangerous situations, which may result in damage to our aircraft.
Volatility in international currency markets may adversely affect demand for our services.
We rely on third party service providers. If these service providers do not deliver the high level of service and support required in our business, we may lose customers and revenue.
We could be adversely affected by a failure or disruption of our computer, communications or other technology systems.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY
The market for air cargo services is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose current customers or fail to attract new customers.
We are subject to extensive governmental regulations and our failure to comply with these regulations in the U.S. and abroad, or the adoption of any new laws, policies or regulations or changes to such regulations may have an adverse effect on our business.
The airline industry is subject to numerous security regulations and rules which increase costs. Imposition of more stringent regulations and rules than those that currently exist could materially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our future operations might be constrained by a new FAA requirement pertaining to ultra long range operations.
Risks Related to Our ACMI Business
We depend on a limited number of significant customers for our ACMI business, and the loss of one or more of such customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We could be adversely affected if a large number of 747-400 passenger-to-freighter converted aircraft enter the ACMI market and cause ACMI rates to decrease. In addition, new entrants or different equipment types introduced into the ACMI market could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We could be adversely affected if the delivery our new 747-8F aircraft are delayed further or if such aircraft do not meet expected performance specifications.
Risks Related to the DHL Investment
Our agreements with DHL require us to meet certain performance targets in our Express Network ACMI, including certain departure/arrival reliability standards. Failure to meet these performance targets could adversely affect our financial results.
The DHL Agreements confer certain termination rights to DHL which, if exercised or triggered, may result in us being unable to realize the full benefits of this transaction.
Risks Related to Our AMC Charter Business
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our AMC Charter business, and a substantial portion of these revenues have been generated pursuant to expansion flying, as opposed to fixed contract arrangements with the AMC. In the longer term, we expect that the revenues from our AMC Charter business may decline from current levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our AMC Charter business is sensitive to teaming arrangements and our relative share of AMC flying. If one of our team members reduces its commitments or withdraws from the program, or if other carriers on other teams commit additional aircraft to this program, our share of AMC flying may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK
The sale or purchase of shares by our principal stockholder could affect the price of our common stock.
The concentration of our capital stock ownership could discourage a takeover that other stockholders may consider favorable and make it more difficult for them to elect directors of their choosing.
Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
