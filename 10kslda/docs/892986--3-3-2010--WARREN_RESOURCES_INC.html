                    Risks Relating to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business
Oil and natural gas prices are volatile. Volatility in oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect our results and the price of our common stock. This volatility also makes valuation of natural gas and oil producing properties difficult and can disrupt markets.
A decline in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations, financial commitments, financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to grow.
We have incurred losses and may do so in the future.
Our proved reserves are estimates based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.
The continuing crisis in U.S. and world financial and securities markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
Our credit facility contains operating restrictions and financial covenants, and we may have difficulty obtaining additional credit.
We are subject to the full cost ceiling limitation which resulted in a write-down of our estimated net reserves in 2008 and may result in a write-down of our estimated net reserves in the future.
We are limiting new drilling as a result of lower commodity pricing and limited access to capital markets, which could lead to a decline in our oil and gas reserves, revenues and results of operations.
Our development and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas and oil reserves.
Unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.
Our identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.
We face significantly increasing water disposal costs in our CBM drilling operations.
We face significantly increasing natural gas disposal regulations and costs in our Wilmington oil drilling operations that could limit our oil production.
Operational impediments may hinder our access to natural gas and oil markets or delay our production.
We may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change
Our hedging activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.
We may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration and development activities, which would reduce our financial flexibility and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Properties that we buy may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them, which could cause us to incur losses.
Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.
As co-venturer in joint ventures, we are liable for various obligations of those joint ventures.
Our role as co-venturer in joint ventures may result in conflicts of interest, which may not be resolved in our best interests or the best interests of our stockholders.
The loss of our chief executive officer or other key management and technical personnel or our inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.
We do not insure against all potential operating risks. We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of various lawsuits.
We have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenues.
Defects in the title to any of our natural gas and oil interests could result in the loss of some of our natural gas and oil properties or portions thereof, or liability for losses resulting from defects in the assignment of leasehold rights.
Drilling for and producing natural gas and oil are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Prospects that we decide to drill may not yield natural gas or oil in commercially viable quantities.
Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources than we do, which may adversely affect our ability to compete.
Shortages of rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel could delay or otherwise adversely affect our cost of operations or our ability to operate according to our business plans.
Increases in taxes on energy sources may adversely affect the company's operations.
Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock
The number of shares eligible for future sale or which have registration rights could adversely affect the future market for our common stock.
Our stock price has been and may be volatile, and your investment in our stock could decline in value.
Control by our executive officers and directors may limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval and could discourage our potential acquisition by third parties.
Provisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Maryland law may make it more difficult to effect a change in control, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of Warren's Consolidated Financial Statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Failure of the Company's internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results.
