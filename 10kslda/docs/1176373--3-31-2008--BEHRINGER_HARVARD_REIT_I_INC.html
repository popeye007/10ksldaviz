                    Risks Related to Our Business in General
A limit on the number of shares a person may own may discourage a takeover.
Our charter permits our board of directors to issue additional shares of stock, which may dilute your voting power, subordinate your rights or discourage a third-party from acquiring us.
Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired.
Maryland law also limits the ability of a third-party to buy a large stake in us and exercise voting power in electing directors.
Your investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
You are bound by the majority vote on matters on which you are entitled to vote.
Stockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations.
Our board of directors may change our investment policies without stockholder approval, which could alter the nature of your investment.
Your interest in Behringer Harvard REIT I will be diluted if we issue additional shares.
Payment of fees to Behringer Advisors and its affiliates will reduce cash available for investment and payment of distributions.
Because our ability to replace our property manager is restricted, we may be unable to terminate the property management agreement at the desired time, which may adversely affect our operations and the distributions we are able to pay to our stockholders.
Distributions may be paid from capital, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve expected cash flows necessary to continue to pay currently established distributions or maintain distributions at any particular level, or that distributions will increase over time.
Until we generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make distributions to our stockholders, we may make distributions from other sources in anticipation of future operating cash flow, which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest and may negatively impact the value of your investment.
Adverse economic conditions may negatively affect our returns and profitability, which could negatively impact our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders.
We and the other public programs sponsored by affiliates of Behringer Advisors have experienced losses in the past, and we may experience similar losses in the future.
We are uncertain of our sources for funding of future capital needs, which could adversely affect the value of our investments.
Instability in the credit market and real estate market could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to you.
To hedge against exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, we may use derivative financial instruments that may be costly and ineffective and may reduce the overall returns on your investment.
Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge risk effectively.
The State of Texas recently enacted legislation that creates a new margin tax and decreases state property taxes. This tax reform could result in decreased reimbursable expenses from tenants, and increased taxes on our operations, which could reduce the cash available for distribution to you.
General Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate
Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that may have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable or that we will realize growth in the value of our real estate assets.
Properties that have significant vacancies could be difficult to sell, which could diminish the return on your real estate properties.
The inability of a significant tenant or number of tenants to pay rent when due may negatively impact the revenues generated by our real property investments.
We may be unable to secure funds for future tenant improvements, which could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders.
We may be unable to sell a property if or when we decide to do so, which could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders.
Our co-venture partners, co-tenants or other partners in co-ownership arrangements could take actions contrary to our interests.
We may suffer uninsured losses relating to real property or pay excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage.
Development and construction projects are subject to delays that may materially increase the cost to complete the project.
Our earnest money deposit may not be refunded.
We compete with third parties in acquiring properties and other assets.
A concentration of our investments in any one property class may leave our profitability vulnerable to a downturn in that sector.
Acquiring or attempting to acquire multiple properties in a single transaction may adversely affect our operations.
Our operating results will be negatively affected if our investments, including investments in TIC interests sponsored by our sponsor, do not meet projected distribution levels.
If we set aside insufficient capital reserves, we may be required to defer necessary property improvements, which could adversely affect our operating results.
The cost of complying with environmental and other governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our income and the cash available for any distributions.
Discovery of previously undetected environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect our operating results.
Our costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect cash available for distributions.
If we sell properties by providing financing to purchasers, we will bear the risk of default by the purchaser.
Risks Associated with Debt Financing
We incur mortgage indebtedness and other borrowings, which increases our business risks.
If mortgage debt is unavailable at reasonable rates, we may not be able to refinance our properties, which could reduce the number of properties we can acquire and the amount of cash distributions we can make.
Lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
Interest-only indebtedness may increase our risk of default and ultimately may reduce our funds available for distribution to our stockholders.
Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
Financing arrangements involving balloon payment obligations may adversely affect our ability to make distributions.
We have broad authority to incur debt, and high debt levels could hinder our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of your investment.
Risks Related to an Investment in Behringer Harvard REIT I
We may suffer from delays in locating suitable investments, which could adversely affect the return on your investment.
We may have to make decisions on whether to invest in certain properties without detailed information on the property.
If we lose or are unable to obtain key personnel, our ability to implement our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered.
If we internalize our management functions, your voting power in us could be diluted, and we could incur other significant costs associated with being self-managed.
Our rights, and the rights of our stockholders, to recover claims against our officers, directors and advisor are limited.
Your investment may be subject to additional risks if we make international investments.
We do not have substantial experience with international investments.
Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest
Because a number of Behringer Harvard real estate programs use investment strategies that are similar to ours, Behringer Advisors and its and our executive officers will face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase and leasing of properties and other investments, and these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.
Behringer Advisors will face conflicts of interest relating to joint ventures, TIC investments or other co-ownership arrangements that we enter with other Behringer Harvard-sponsored programs, which could result in a disproportionate benefit to another Behringer Harvard-sponsored program.
Our advisor s executive officers and key personnel and the executive officers and key personnel of Behringer Harvard-affiliated entities that conduct our day-to-day operations and our offering will face competing demands on their time, and this may cause our investment returns to suffer
Our officers face conflicts of interest related to the positions they hold with other entities affiliated with Behringer Advisors, which could diminish the value of the services they provide to us.
Your investment will be diluted upon conversion of the convertible stock.
Behringer Advisors faces conflicts of interest relating to the incentive fee structure under
management agreement, which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.
Because we rely on affiliates of Behringer Harvard Holdings to provide advisory, property management and dealer manager services, if Behringer Harvard Holdings is unable to meet its obligations we may be required to find alternative providers of these services, which could disrupt our business.
Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate-Related Securities
Recent market conditions and the risk of continued market deterioration may reduce the value of any real estate related securities in which we may invest.
Investments in real estate-related-securities will be subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities and may be subject to the general risks of investing in subordinated real estate securities.
The fees that we pay to invest in real estate-related securities will be greater than any fees that you would pay to invest directly in these securities.
Investments in real estate preferred equity securities involve a greater risk of loss than traditional debt financing.
The mezzanine loans in which we may invest would involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income producing real properties.
We may make investments in non-U.S. dollar denominated securities, which will be subject to currency rates exposure and the uncertainty of foreign laws and markets.
We expect that a portion of any real estate-related securities investments we make will be illiquid and we may not be able to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions.
Interest rate and related risks may cause the value of our real estate-related securities investments to be reduced.
We have not made any investments in real estate-related securities.
We may acquire real estate-related securities through tender offers, which may require us to spend significant amounts of time and money that otherwise could be allocated to our operations.
Risks Associated with Mortgage Lending
We may not have the expertise necessary to maximize the return on our investments in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans.
Our mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans may be impacted by unfavorable real estate market conditions, which could decrease the value of those loans.
Our mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans will be subject to interest rate fluctuations, which could reduce our returns as compared to market interest rates and reduce the value of the loans if we sell the loans.
We may experience delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage, mezzanine or bridge loans, which could delay our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders.
Returns on our mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans may be limited by regulations.
Foreclosures create additional ownership risks that could adversely impact our returns on mortgage investments.
The liquidation of our assets may be delayed, which could delay distributions to our stockholders.
Risks Associated with Section 1031 TIC Transactions
We may have increased exposure to liabilities from litigation as a result of our participation in Section 1031 TIC transactions.
We may have increased business and litigation risks as a result of any direct sales by us of TIC interests in Section 1031 TIC transactions.
We are subject to certain risks in connection with our arrangements with Behringer Harvard Exchange Entities.
We have acquired certain properties in the form of TIC or other co-tenancy arrangements and we may enter into more such arrangements in the future. Therefore, we are subject to risks associated with co-tenancy arrangements that otherwise may not be present in non-co-tenancy real estate investments.
Our interests may become adverse to those of a co-tenant.
Our participation in Section 1031 TIC Transactions may limit our ability to borrow funds in the future, which could adversely affect the value of our investments.
Failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions.
Failure to maintain an acquired entity s REIT status may cause us to lose our REIT status.
Certain fees paid to us may affect our REIT status.
Recharacterization of the Section 1031 TIC Transactions may result in taxation of income from a prohibited transaction, which would diminish distributions to our stockholders.
You may have current tax liability on distributions you elect to reinvest in our common stock.
If our operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership, its income may be subject to tax at corporate rates.
In certain circumstances, we may be subject to federal and state taxes on income as a REIT, which would reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
Non-U.S. income or other taxes, and a requirement to withhold any non-U.S. taxes, may apply, and, if so, the amount of net cash from operations payable to you will be reduced.
Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect investors.
Equity participation in mortgage, bridge, mezzanine or other loans may result in taxable income and gains from these properties that could adversely impact our REIT status.
