                    The profit margin of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott, including any improvements or iterations approved for sale during the term of the applicable supply arrangements and of the type that could be approved by a supplement to an approved FDA pre-market approval, is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS
stent systems, and an increase in sales of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott relative to TAXUS
stent system net sales may continue to adversely impact our gross profit and operating profit margins. The price we pay Abbott for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott is further impacted by our arrangements with Abbott and is subject to retroactive adjustment, which may also negatively impact our profit margins.
We incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of Guidant and if we are unable to manage our debt levels, through refinancing or otherwise, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
We may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
We may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and Plant Network Optimization initiatives; our long-term expense reduction programs may result in an increase in short-term expense; and our efforts may lead to additional unintended consequences.
Healthcare policy changes, including pending proposals to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on us.
Our products, including those of our cardiovascular businesses, are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or other third parties, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our future growth is dependent upon the development of new products, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals, all of which are very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in a commercially viable product.
We may not be successful in our strategic acquisitions of, investments in, or alliances with, other companies and businesses, which have been a significant source of historical growth for us, and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologies.
The medical device industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and is the subject of numerous investigations, often involving marketing and other business practices. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings; substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies; divert the attention of our management; impose administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.
Should we be unable to resolve our FDA corporate warning letter, our business, financial condition and results of operations, our relationship with the FDA, and physician perception of our products could be materially adversely affected.
We may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products.
Current economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations.
We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.
Pending and future product liability claims and other litigation, including private securities litigation, shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation, may adversely affect our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain customers.
We face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Because we derive a significant amount of our net sales from international operations and a significant percentage of our future growth is expected to come from international operations, changes in international economic or regulatory conditions could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Healthcare cost containment pressures and legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors or preferences for alternate therapies could decrease the demand for our products, the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
We rely on external manufacturers to supply us with certain materials, components and products, as well as external providers to sterilize our products. Any disruption in our sources of supply or our ability to sterilize our products could adversely impact our production efforts and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our share price will fluctuate, and accordingly, the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuate.
