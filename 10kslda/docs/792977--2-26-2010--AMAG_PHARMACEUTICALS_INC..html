                    We are solely dependent on the success of Feraheme.
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries is intense. If our competitors are able to develop and market products that are or are perceived to be more effective, safer, more convenient or have more favorable pricing, insurance coverage, coding and reimbursement than Feraheme, the commercial opportunity for Feraheme will be adversely impacted.
Feraheme may not be widely adopted by physicians, patients, healthcare payors, and the major operators of dialysis clinics in the U.S.
Our ability to generate future revenues from Feraheme depends heavily on the ability of end-users to receive adequate reimbursement for the use of Feraheme in a timely manner.
In the U.S. there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to reform the healthcare system in ways that could adversely impact the available reimbursement for, and therefore our ability to sell Feraheme profitably.
Significant safety or drug interaction problems could arise with respect to Feraheme, resulting in recalls, restrictions in Feraheme's label, withdrawal of Feraheme from the market, or cause us to alter or terminate future Feraheme clinical development programs.
We have limited experience independently commercializing a pharmaceutical product, and any failure on our part to effectively execute our Feraheme commercial plans would have a severe adverse impact on our business.
We have limited experience independently distributing a pharmaceutical product, and our Feraheme commercialization plans could suffer if we fail to effectively manage and maintain our supply chain and distribution network.
We may not be able to operate our manufacturing facility in compliance with current good manufacturing practices and other FDA regulations, which could result in a suspension of our ability to manufacture Feraheme, the loss of our Feraheme inventory, our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of Feraheme to meet demand, or other unanticipated compliance costs.
We currently manufacture Feraheme at one manufacturing facility without a qualified second source manufacturer, and if we experience any difficulties, disruptions or delays in the manufacturing process, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of Feraheme to meet commercial demand or continue our Feraheme development efforts.
If we cannot produce sufficient quantities of Feraheme at our manufacturing facility, we will need to rely on third party manufacturers, which may expose us to a number of risks.
Our inability to obtain raw materials and our reliance on sole source suppliers could adversely impact our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of Feraheme, which would have a severe adverse impact on our business.
Our operating results will likely fluctuate so you should not rely on the results of any single quarter to predict how we will perform over time.
Wholesaler and distributor buying patterns and other factors may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate, and these fluctuations may adversely affect our short-term results.
If the estimates we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary from those reflected in our projections and accruals
Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and your investment in our stock could decline in value or fluctuate significantly.
If securities analysts downgrade our stock, cease coverage of us, or if our operating results do not meet analysts' forecasts and expectations, our stock price could decline.
We have a history of net losses, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve and maintain profitability in the future.
We may need additional capital to achieve our business objectives.
We may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, or acquisition agreements that could disrupt our business, decrease our profitability, result in dilution to stockholders or cause us to incur debt or significant additional expense.
The investment of our cash is subject to risks, which may cause losses or adversely affect the liquidity of these investments.
Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be limited as a result of the sale of shares of our common stock in our January 2010 public offering or other past or future transactions involving our common stock.
The current credit and financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business.
If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under governmental pricing programs, we could be required to reimburse government programs for underpayments and could be required to pay penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
We are subject to ongoing regulatory review of Feraheme, and if we fail to comply with such continuing regulations, we could be subject to penalties up to and including the suspension of the manufacturing, marketing and sale of Feraheme.
If we market or distribute our products in a manner that violates federal or state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, marketing disclosure laws or other federal or state laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
Our ability to grow revenues from sales of Feraheme will be limited if we do not obtain approval, or if we experience significant delays in our efforts to obtain approval to market Feraheme for additional indications in the U.S.
Our ability to grow revenues from sales of Feraheme will be limited if we do not obtain approval, or if we experience significant delays in our efforts to obtain approval to market Feraheme in countries outside of the U.S.
We rely on third parties in the conduct of our clinical trials, and if they fail to fulfill their obligations, our development plans may be adversely affected.
If we do not effectively manage our growth, our ability to commercialize Feraheme, pursue opportunities and expand our business could be adversely affected.
Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees.
Our success depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
If we identify a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to meet our reporting obligations and the trading price of our stock could be negatively affected.
We are exposed to a number of different potential liability claims, and we may not be able to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance coverage to protect our cash and other assets.
We could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility, which, if it occurs, will distract our management and could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us.
Our shareholder rights plan, certain provisions in our charter and by-laws, certain contractual relationships and certain Delaware law provisions could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current members of our Board of Directors.
We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.
