                    Our recent revenue growth rate may not be sustainable, which could negatively affect our stock price or financial condition and results of operations.
If we experience excessive rates of subscriber churn, our revenues and business will be harmed.
Because we recognize revenues from subscriptions to our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in subscription sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results and therefore could affect our operating results in later periods.
Because we generate substantially all of our revenue from online family history resources, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, a decline in demand for our services or for online family history resources in general, and particularly of the United States and United Kingdom, could cause our revenue to decline.
A change in our mix of subscription durations could have a significant impact on our revenue and churn.
Challenges in acquiring historical content and making it available online could adversely affect our ability to retain and expand our subscriber base, and therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We depend in part upon third party licenses for some of our historical content, and a loss of those licenses, or disputes regarding royalties under these licenses, could adversely affect our ability to retain and expand our subscriber base, and therefore adversely affect our revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
Digitizing and indexing new content can take a significant amount of time and expense, and can expose us to risks associated with the loss or damage of historical documents. Our inability to maintain or acquire content or make new content available online in a timely and cost-effective manner, or liability for loss of historical documents, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We face competition from a number of different sources, and our failure to compete effectively with current and future competitors could adversely affect our ability to retain and expand our subscriber base, and therefore adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
Competitive pricing pressures could cause us to fail to retain existing or attract new subscribers and harm our revenues and results of operations.
Our growth could strain our personnel, technology and infrastructure resources, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.
Any significant disruption in service on our Web sites or in our computer systems, which are currently hosted primarily by a single third-party, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of subscribers, which would harm our business and operating results.
Our operating results depend on numerous factors and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could make them difficult to predict.
We require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, which reduces the cash available to finance our organic growth and strategic acquisitions, alliances and collaborations. If we fail to grow as a result of limitations on available cash, it could harm our financial condition and stock price.
We may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available. If we fail to obtain additional financing if needed, it could harm our growth and our ability to respond to business challenges.
If our marketing and advertising efforts fail to generate additional revenues on a cost-effective basis, or if we are unable to manage our marketing and advertising expenses, it could harm our results of operations and growth.
We cannot predict what impact, if any, the television show Who Do You Think You Are? will have on our business.
If we are unable to improve market recognition of and loyalty to our brands, or if our reputation were to be harmed, we could lose subscribers or fail to increase the number of subscribers, which could harm our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
Our business could be adversely affected if our subscribers are not satisfied with our products and services. If we lose subscribers or fail to increase the number of subscribers due to dissatisfaction with our products and services, it could harm our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
Our promotional offerings and our introduction of new services may have unintended effects on the demand for our services, which could result in diminished revenue visibility.
We face many risks associated with our plans to continue to expand our international offerings and marketing and advertising efforts, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to continually enhance our products and services and adapt them to technological changes and subscriber needs, we may not remain competitive and our business may fail to grow or decline.
Undetected product or service errors or defects could result in the loss of revenues, delayed market acceptance of our products or services or claims against us.
Privacy concerns could require us to incur significant expense and modify our operations in a manner that could result in restrictions and prohibitions on our use of certain information, and therefore harm our business.
Our possession and use of personal information presents risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation.
Any claims related to activities of registered users and the content they upload could result in expenses that could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
Increases in credit card processing fees would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations, and the termination of our relationship with any major credit card company would have a severe, negative impact on our ability to collect revenues from subscribers.
If government regulation of the Internet or other areas of our business changes or if consumer attitudes toward use of the Internet change, we may need to change the manner in which we conduct our business in a manner that is less profitable or incur greater operating expenses, which could harm our results of operations.
Our revenues may be adversely affected if we are required to charge sales taxes in additional jurisdictions and/or other taxes for our products and services.
We face risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect our operating results.
If we acquire any businesses or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our ongoing business, dilute stockholder value or have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our business may be significantly impacted by a change in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer spending.
The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.
We are subject to additional regulatory compliance matters as a result of becoming a public company, which compliance includes Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and our management has limited experience managing a public company. Failure to comply with these regulatory matters could harm our business.
Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.
Any expenses or liability resulting from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property
If our intellectual property and technologies are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.
Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information. Failure to protect our proprietary information could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products and harm our business.
Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our Web sites and marketing and advertising activities.
If we are unable to protect our domain names, our reputation and brand could be affected adversely, which would adversely affect our subscriber base, and therefore adversely affect our revenues.
Risks Related to our Corporate Structure
Our share price may be volatile due to fluctuations in our operating results and other factors, each of which could cause our stock price to decline.
If an insufficient number of securities or industry analysts publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
Our principal stockholder and its affiliates own a majority of our outstanding common stock, and their interests may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock.
Delaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.
Substantial sales of our common stock by our stockholders, including sales pursuant to 10b5-1 plans, could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results.
